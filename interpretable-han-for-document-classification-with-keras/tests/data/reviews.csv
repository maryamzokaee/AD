"when at the very start of the film paleontologist donald sutherland arrives at the argyle familys house and it comes out he is the undeniable alibi for one of the members executed for murdering his mother two years ago your sensation is that you are about to watch a top thriller; an innocent man has been convicted and a killer is still around. but as the film runs along your disappointment increases inevitably.ordeal by innocence is a dull and at times even boring film that doesnt raise at any moment. nothing interesting happens all along and even the final revealing of the facts lacks surprise and intensity (wether you guessed or not).donald sutherland, cristopher plummer, faye dunaway and sarah miles (far from her good performance in ryans daughter) just pass through their roles and not very enthusiastically either.you wont miss much if you skip this one.",0
"i first viewed they died with there boots on,about 1970 and though it has been many years since,this film and its impression remain.the cast was good to excellent and the lead man was truly heroic.when i first saw this film i knew the wisest as well as the only real position to have was to enjoy this film as a rousing bit of entertainment and then some.i felt then as i even feel now that the silver screen does not as such provide for a true depiction of much of anything let alone the life of george armstrong custer,however the director raoul walsh was to contribute to the real value represented in this film when i watched a semi-documentary with other great directors like vincent mennelli wherein these central figures talked about there accomplishments with valuable comments providing a glimpse into the hollywood mind set.this is what i considered something of interest and where all of this became terribly interesting and very enjoyable.yet, there have been so much made of all the problems with the silver screen and its story telling ability that some of the enjoyment has been lost and perhaps you would find that to be true here as well.custer ranked 34 in a graduating class of...34.much has been made of custers final class ranking,but of the 68 cadets who entered the military academy with him in 1857,half of them had already flunked out or quit by graduation day,june 24,1861.it is suggested in the movie as the various instructors are determining if a soldier is fit for command and then they come upon the name of george armstrong custer and there is to be certain an exchange between the two sides and here is where the sargeant on duty says in almost a low tone even to suggest as if that came out by accidenthis squadron would follow him to hell,your at attention sargeant,reprimands tape.if iam not mistaken when flynn shows up at a initial battlefield it acknowledged that custer did not see action right away and indeed he was doing work as a reliable attachã© to not only sheridan,but hancocks forces as well only to end up for a time with the army of the potomac under general george mcclellan.there is some truth to the audacity attributed to custers battlefield heroics as was illustrated when in a counterattack ,young custer spurred his horse to the lead and boldly plunged in among the stunned confederates.as a lone union soldier surrounded by rebels,custers audacity shone through.he accepted the surrender of several enemy soldiers,including a rebel captain.yet most outstanding was that in this action he personally captured the very first confederate battle flag taken by the army of the potomac.this notable act of courage marked him as an officer of great battlefield promise.robert l.bateman-armchair general.there is a problem here and that is the telling of the story and the truth as to george armstrong custer,the story is good hollywood entertainment perhaps even great entertainment but for whatever reasons all that could be told was changed for entertainment purposes.though this maybe jumping the gun it might be well to know that tom custer was to lose his life at the little big horn only a few feet from where george custer was to die as well.they were brothers and tom custer to this very day holds a honorable distinction of being amongst a very small group perhaps only 3 others to have been awarded the medal of honor twice in his military career.the list of engagements that the motion picture shows indicate that custers indeed was an active young officer.he was not with union forces at either chancellorsville or for that matter fredericksburg however he was with them at the battle of antietam and at that point in time he was actually promoted to captain by general mcclellan but that was not to last as mcclellan was soon to be replaced due to the historical fact that the army of the potomac had the means,and the information(discovered wrapped around some cigars was general lees plans to split his forces)and yet he failed to act for some 17 hours.it can be speculated that the war could of been over then and there had that occurred but when mcclellan failed to act president lincoln replaced him permanently and the promotion was lost as a result. custers greatest victory may of in fact come at gettysburg,pa.his forces which occupied an area called cemetery ridge at the field at gettysburg in the summer of 1863 were able to defeat a jeb stuart led cavalry of some 6,000 rebels with but a force of 2,300.i think the heroics at gettysburg by custer are worth some discussion.there is speculation had in the movie that custers appointment was a blunder, well you better guess again because not only did custer have men in his corner but he established a petition to present to the governor of the state of michigan which by the way was relatively new to the union cause and where preparing to form cavalry regiments.though custer was severely admonished for that kind of shenanigan when he showed up in all that gold braid it was not by accident as you would be led to believe.the truth be told custers defense at gettysburg prohibited jeb stuart from having lunch at the unions rear stores and vitally protected that flank.this action by the way occurred and it was timed to coincide with picketts charge so to make for the greatest likelihood of success.it was a critical victory and custer was at his bravest and best.his men did follow him to hell and lived to tell about it.",1
"another asian horror movie packed with intense, and creepy moments. another asian horror trademark is the complexity of the plot, which is here as well. major spoiler warning!the movie starts pretty simple - two sisters go to live with their dad and stepmother after being put in a mental institution after their mother hanged herself. the sisters seem very hostile towards their mother - especially the elder one - and they seem to ignore their father. all goes smoothly until the mother locks the young sister in the wardrobe and the elder sister tells her father. then it hits you, your sister has been dead for years now it turns out the older sister is still not recovered from the death of her mother and what we didnt know is that the wardrobe the mother was hanged in fell on the younger sister and killed her as well.as for the stepmother she is the alter ego of the older sister - revealed when the stepmother (actually the sisters alter ego) is sitting on a couch when the real stepmother walks in! i hope it has been made clearer for confused asian horror fans out there.finally - my favourite scene is the scene where the father invites friends over for dinner and one of the friends starts to choke which erupts into a panic attack. very creepy! 7 out of 10",1
"i think that would have been a more appropriate title for this film, since it is padded to hell and back with stock footage of various bugs and animals. i recently found the prey in its original vhs big box form and was very excited. i just love finding old slasher films on vhs because the cover artwork is fantastic. usually though, it turns out that the film itself is less than fantastic. the prey is one of those films.to be fair, it started off ok, with the killer stalking the clichã© teenagers in the woods. the heartbeat sounds used are a great effect that make you tense as you watch. this film is basically a big fat clichã©, and when the campfire stories section rolls in, the film takes a new direction and spends almost half of the running time on the back-story of the killer. i actually thought this was quite an original idea. however, the back-story ends abruptly and shows us some stock-footage of a burning woodland (the lack of budget really starts to show now). after this, we are returned to the dumb teenagers being picked off in the woods. the killer himself isnt shown until the end, which is a shame because he actually makes an effective looking killer. sort of like cropsy from the burning, but better. as for gore, there isnt too much, although theres an ok face squishing moment at the end. overall, i wouldnt recommend this film to anyone other than slasher completists - it really is a big mess.",0
"thank god i didnt buy this movie myself! i borrowed it from a friend who bought it out of sheer curiosity and of course after viewing it feel they should be reimbursed! this has got to be one of the worse movies ive ever seen! i do realize they couldnt have had much of a budget but i swear i could make a better movie than this staring my pets! the acting was horrible, so was the editing, the dialogue, everything! it was so bad that it was seriously making me angry as i watched it! im looking forward to the real movie about this story coming out soon so that people curious about it dont have to stoop to watch this joke!",0
"quitting may be as much about exiting a pre-ordained identity as about drug withdrawal. as a rural guy coming to beijing, class and success must have struck this young artist face on as an appeal to separate from his roots and far surpass his peasant parents acting success. troubles arise, however, when the new man is too new, when it demands too big a departure from family, history, nature, and personal identity. the ensuing splits, and confusion between the imaginary and the real and the dissonance between the ordinary and the heroic are the stuff of a gut check on the one hand or a complete escape from self on the other. hongshen slips into the latter and his long and lonely road back to self can be grim.but what an exceptionally convincing particularity, honesty, and sensuousness director zhang yang, and his actors, bring to this journey. no clichã©s, no stereotypes, no rigid gender roles, no requisite sex, romance or violence scenes, no requisite street language and, to boot, no assumed money to float character acts and whims. hongshen jia is in his mid-twenties. hes a talented actor, impressionable, vain, idealistic, and perhaps emotionally starved. the perfect recipe for his enablers. soon hes the cool actor, idolized by youth. he was hot in the early nineties. he always had to be the most fashionable. he needs extremes, and goes in for heavy metal, adopts earrings and a scarf. his acting means the arts, friends--and roles, but not the kind that offer any personal challenge or input. and his self-criticism, dulled by the immediacy of success, opens the doors to an irrational self-doubt, self-hatred-- i didnt know how to act i felt like a phony--and to readily available drugs to counter them. he says i had to get high to do what director wanted. so, his shallow identity as an actor becomes, via drugs, an escape from identity. hongshens disengagement from drugs and his false life is very gradual, intermittent--and doggedly his own. solitude, space, meditative thinking, speech refusal, replace therapy. the abstract is out. and a great deal of his change occurs outdoors---not in idealized locations but mainly on green patches under the freeways, bridges, and high-rises of beijing. the physicality is almost romantic, but is not. the bike rides to ritan park, the long spontaneous walks, the drenching sun and rain, grassy picnics, the sky patterns and kites that absorb his musing are very specific. he drifts in order to arrive, all the while picking up cues to a more real and realistic identity. i started to open up he says of this period in retrospect. and the contact seems to start with his lanky body which projects a kind of dancers positioning (clumsy, graceful, humorous, telling) in a current circumstance. if mind or spirit is lacking, his legs can compel him to walk all night. central to his comeback is the rejection of set roles. to punctuate his end to acting and his determination to a new identity, he smashes his videos and tv, and bangs his head till bloody against his john lennon forever poster. he has let down his iconic anti-establishment artist---but hes the only viable guide he knows. he even imagines himself as johns son (yoko ono), and adopts his mother mary as an intercessor in his hour of darkness and time of trouble. (the wrenching, shaking pain in the park--hallucinatory and skitzoid ordeals) music is so much more real than acting he says. and speaks of lennons influence as showing me a new way. in the mental institute, the life-saving apples (resistance, nourishment) reflect lennons presence, as does hongshens need to re-hang his heros poster in his redecorated room.if lennons influence is spiriting, hongshens fathers influence is grounding. although father and son are both actors and users (drugs and drink), it is fegsens differences from his son that underwrites his change. for the father is more secure in himself: he accepts that hes chinese, a peasant in a line of peasants, a rural theater director. and he exercises control over both his habit and his emotions. its this recognizable identity that drives hongshen to treat him like a sounding board, sometimes with anger and rage, sometimes with humor (the blue jeans, beatles) and passivity. in his most crazed, and violent exchange with his father in which he accuses him of being a liar, and a fake, he exposes more of himself than his father: all the acts i acted before were bullshit... life is bullshit. and to hongshens emphatic you are not my father, he softly replies, why cant a peasant be your father? under these two teachers and with much additional help from his mother, sister, friends, inmates at the rehab inst., he makes some tangible connection to a real (not whole) self. as the long term drug effects recede, so does his old identity. indebtedness replaces pride, trust distrust. integrity banishes his black cloud. all his edges soften. you are just a human being he repeats endlessly after being released from the strap-down incurred for refusing medicine. back home, lard peasant soap is fine with him now. and his once rare and true friendships begin again as is so evident in the back to poignant back-to-back fence scene with his musician buddy. hongshen says of this movie: its a good chance to think about my life. and i might add, become a new actor, one bound to art and life. like lennon, he has gained success without a loss of identity.",1
wow! i think they made this movie to torture people. there are no words for how much i hated this film. i could have been cleaning my room instead. i love bad melodrama as much as the next person but....come on!,0
"actor turned director bill paxton follows up his promising debut, the gothic-horror frailty, with this family friendly sports drama about the 1913 u.s. open where a young american caddy rises from his humble background to play against his bristish idol in what was dubbed as the greatest game ever played. im no fan of golf, and these scrappy underdog sports flicks are a dime a dozen (most recently done to grand effect with miracle and cinderella man), but some how this film was enthralling all the same.the film starts with some creative opening credits (imagine a disneyfied version of the animated opening credits of hbos carnivale and rome), but lumbers along slowly for its first by-the-numbers hour. once the action moves to the u.s. open things pick up very well. paxton does a nice job and shows a knack for effective directorial flourishes (i loved the rain-soaked montage of the action on day two of the open) that propel the plot further or add some unexpected psychological depth to the proceedings. theres some compelling character development when the british harry vardon is haunted by images of the aristocrats in black suits and top hats who destroyed his family cottage as a child to make way for a golf course. he also does a good job of visually depicting what goes on in the players heads under pressure. golf, a painfully boring sport, is brought vividly alive here. credit should also be given the set designers and costume department for creating an engaging period-piece atmosphere of london and boston at the beginning of the twentieth century.you know how this is going to end not only because its based on a true story but also because films in this genre follow the same template over and over, but paxton puts on a better than average show and perhaps indicates more talent behind the camera than he ever had in front of it. despite the formulaic nature, this is a nice and easy film to root for that deserves to find an audience.",1
"so tell me - what serious boozer drinks budweiser? how many suicidally-obsessed drinkers house a fully stocked and barely touched range of drinks in their lonely motel room that a millionaire playboys bachelor-pad bar would be proud to boast? and what kind of an alcoholic tends to drink with the bottle held about 8 inches from his hungry mouth so that the contents generally spill all over his face? not to mention wasting good whisky by dousing your girlfriends tits with it, just so the cinema audience can get a good eyeful of elisabeth shues assets.cage seems to be portraying the most attention-seeking look-at-me alcoholic ever to have graced the screen while shue looks more like a berkely preppy slumming it for a summer than some seasoned street-walker. she is humiliated and subjugated as often as possible in this revolting movie with beatings, skin lacerations, anal rape and graphic verbal abuse - all of it completely implausible and included apparently only to convey a sense of her horribly demeaned state and offer the male viewers an astonishingly clichã©d sentimental sexual fantasy of the tart-with-a-heart.still - i did watch it to the end, by which time i was actually laughing out loud as shues tough street hooker chopped carrots in the kitchen wanly, pathetically smiling while cage - all eyes popping and shaking like like a man operating a road drill in an earthquake - grimaced and mugged his way through the final half-hour...",0
"i had been looking forward to this movie since lost world came out. it didnt bother me that lost world wasnt as intellectual as the original, and here, i was just hoping for a good monster movie. it was all about dinosaurs eat people. however, it was disappointing even on that level.for starters, there were not enough people to eat, and while ill keep it a secret how many people get eaten, it was not enough. also, while there was no shortage of variety in the dinosaur community, there were not nearly enough dinosaurs. and many dinosaurs, like the spikey-back-and-has-a-club-on-its-tail-osaurus, just made cameos and didnt do much considering how cool they are.(start spoilers) then there were the pterodactyls. the figures ive read put their body weight at about 15 pounds, while the movie made them look closer to 300. worse, they didnt get to eat anybody, or even splatter them on the rocks by dropping them from high up. there was no ending to the movie, either, it was just, all of the sudden, credits. (end spoilers) im left wondering if the edition i saw was missing 40 minutes of film.my only conclusion can be that they taught the pterodactyls to stick their long beaks stealthily into your pockets and get your $7. go rent the carnosaur series; at least you wont be disappointed.",0
"is this a bad movie?of course, what were you expecting from a movie called beach babes from beyond?it is a babes in bikini movie and has no pretensions of being otherwise. given, this is not a room with a view or schindlers list. if you wanted a film like a room with a view then you would not be looking at beach babes from beyond. but if you are looking for a good babes in bikini movie with almost no plot, this is the one for you. this flick delivers on what it promises and then some. it is pure 100% adolescent fun.there were lots of babes in and out of bikinis. the movie was quite funny and great to watch. these were some of the most beautiful women i have ever seen on home video.every high school kid should watch at least one bad movie like this. this is actually one of the most memorable movies i have ever seen. so unashamedly, i say again...if you are going to watch only one babes in bikini movie, this is it.",1
"for late-80s cheese, this really isnt so bad. there are a lot of pretty funny throwaway one-liners (that was grand theft! - thanks!) and madonna gives a fine performance; nothing award-worthy here, but that goes for razzies as well as oscars. im curious to know if the movie would have been better received if she had used her regular (pre-british influenced) speaking voice rather than the hyper-bronxy accent used instead. oh well. as a side note, i got to meet one of the actors who played one of the motorcycle cops through my work; he said that it was a fun film to work on but gave me the sad news that the actor who played buck the ups delivery guy died about a year after whos that girl",1
"while i cant say whether or not larry hama ever saw any of the old cartoons, i would think that writing said cartoons, file cards, and some of the comics would count for something.for fans of the old cartoon, this is pretty much a continuation of the same, except with a few new characters - and a more insane cobra commander.we still have all the old favorites too, but on a personal note, one thing that always irritated me was this duke in charge stuff, when there are tons of other *officers* around instead.the battle sequences are similar to the old series as well; the main trick here seems to be the cgi. its overall pretty good, if not a little over-the-top.",1
i saw this movie yesterday and thought it was awful; it was pointless and just plain stupid. the supposed plot concerned a prospective bridegroom too caught up in the problems of the world to relate to his bride and the other people in his life. he disappears on his wedding day (in a tux no less) and hooks up with an assortment of weirdos.we saw it with a bus-load of people on the way down to atlantic city and everyone agreed that it was a terrible movie. it was trying to be profound but it wasnt; it was stupid and offensive. if i wasnt on a bus i would have walked out on the movie. anyone considering seeing the movie or renting or buying the video you have been forewarned.,0
"when i went to see this i thought, i liked the first two and thought that they were very suspenseful so this one should be good also. wrong! there was no suspense and they dont explain about the new dinosaurs! when i was done watching this i had lost all respect for steven spielberg and michael crichton but then it turned out that it wasnt directed by spielberg or written by michael crichton! this movie was going through the motions. i thought that this movie had absolutely no plot and i thought that no one should waste their money to see it.",0
"i love this movie!! sure i love it because of madonna but who cares - its damn funny!!! *alanis rocks*. when i first saw this film in the theatres back in 1987, i thought it was all out hilarious! madonna is so funny and i love her dubbed accent and wacky/funky look. the all-time funniest part is when madonna(nikki) screams at a man who is about to get into a taxi. and also when griffin dunne(louden)trips and falls at the apartment interview scene. **alanis rocks**. madonnas character nikki steals/shop lifts and fools people throughout the whole movie - her hilarious antics are enough to keep you on the floor the whole time. didnt rob nothin, when you rob a store you stick up the cashier. we busted a few tapes, theres a bit of a difference i love that!!! its classic. ***alanis rocks***. i dont know why this movie got slammed the way it did. i see nothing wrong with it - course maybe if youre a huge madonna fan then whatever she does is just awesome. anyone out there who wants to see some funny, classic entertainment then watch whos that girl? and another very important fact that of which should be known to all man kind or at least to all that exist, alanis will always rock ya completely to the end! so does madonna in this film, and just entirely! her acting is superb!",1
"one of the funniest, most romantic, and most musical movies ever; definitely worth renting/buying especially if you have a taste for older style of cinematography. the animals and the songs alone will make you smile while watching the movie. a definite must for madonna fans. :o)",1
"nikki finn is the kind of girl i would marry. never boring, always thinking positively, good with animals. okay, as one reviewer wrote, a bit too much peroxide, lipstick, and eyebrows (only madonna could get away with that). but thats why i love nikki finn, shes not your ordinary girl. she makes things happen, always exciting to be around, and always honest. sure, she steals, but she doesnt rob or murder (unless youre out to do her in). she knows which rules can be broken and which ones should be obeyed. she knows what to take and what cant be stolen. if you need a favor from her, shes in 100%. bottom line: she knows how to enjoy life. nikki is always loving (which is why she has a way with wild animals), and completely dedicated to those she loves, and who love her.whos that girl? shes the girl for me.",1
"i went and saw this movie last night after being coaxed to by a few friends of mine. ill admit that i was reluctant to see it because from what i knew of ashton kutcher he was only able to do comedy. i was wrong. kutcher played the character of jake fischer very well, and kevin costner played ben randall with such professionalism. the sign of a good movie is that it can toy with our emotions. this one did exactly that. the entire theater (which was sold out) was overcome by laughter during the first half of the movie, and were moved to tears during the second half. while exiting the theater i not only saw many women in tears, but many full grown men as well, trying desperately not to let anyone see them crying. this movie was great, and i suggest that you go see it before you judge.",1
"first of all, i would like to say that i am a fan of all of the actors that appear in this film and at the time that i rented it, i wanted to like it.i think that the main reason that i was so disappointed was that the outside box promised me a suspense thriller. in my eyes, a suspense thriller for british movies is like something out of a ruth rendell novel, something that has a lot of dark twist and turns and leaves the viewer with an ending that is unlikely to be forgotten anytime soon.this movie started out with the promising note of being such a film. we have our main character, that suspects a man that he does not like, of being involved in a hit and run that killed the husband of one of his servants.his notions prove to be right, but the idea that his wife might be involved, does not occur to him until that she confesses to him that she was a part of the crime.the elements of a good suspense thriller were in place, at this point, but from there, i felt that the film took a different direction and became almost some sort of a mild soap opera about who wants to be with who and what the love of a real relationship is. the film might have been enjoyable to me, if the outside box had talked of a twisted lovers triangle and had not been labeled as suspense thriller.this seemed to be more of a soap opera story and the beginning setting seemed to be a mild distraction to the true content of the film. i felt like this film could have done a whole lot better than it did. i felt like it kept leading the viewer up to a big event that never materialized. so, i have to give it a lower rating than i would have liked to and say that it fell short of my expectations.",0
"sure, most of the slasher films of the 1980s were not worth thecelluloid they were filmed on, but this video nightmare may well bethe dullest produced.six horny pot smoking students decide to go camping. of course,and you know this already, they begin getting killed one by one by amysterious stranger. the climax has a hunky forest ranger trying toget to the teens in time before the last cute girl becomes buzzardbait.john carl buechler, my least favorite b-movie guy, did the lousymakeup effects here. the cast features carel struycken, of thewitches of eastwick and the addams family movies. sadly, hedoes not pop up until the very end of the film, and is covered inburn makeup, rendering him unrecognizable. steve bond (anyoneremember him?) is here in an early role as a victim.browns direction, and the script he cowrote, both smell like thepresents brown bears leave in the woods. he pads the film withso much stock wilderness footage, i thought i accidentally rented aspecial episode of mutual of omahas wild kingdom. much of thecast sits around the campfire and eats, then walk, and sit and eatagain. the forest ranger is involved in the strangest scene ever putin a slasher film: he tells a joke about a wide mouthed frog to ababy deer. jackie coogan, who must have forgot he once workedwith the legends of silent cinema, has two scenes, and is involvedin the second strangest scene ever put in a slasher film: he andthe hunky forest ranger have a conversation about cucumber andcream cheese sandwiches on oatmeal bread...yeah.there is not one minute of suspense here. the killer, a forest firesurvivor looking for a mate, watches the students from behindtrees. we know it is the killer because the film makers havedubbed in a heart beat sound effect that helpfully serves to wakethe viewer up every few minutes. skip this pile of pine sap and renthalloween, instead.this is rated (r) for physical violence, mild gun violence, gore,some profanity, brief female nudity, mild sexual content, sexualreferences, and drug abuse.",0
"i walked into a book store in brentwood, tennessee. i am not going to say the name because i am a dedicated customer. i have been satisfied with every item i purchased there before this one. on display in the front of the store was the bell witch haunting.

"felix is watching an actor rehearse his lines: a ham, a ham! my kingdom for a ham sandwich!!! the dramatic guy that tells felix hell have to sacrifice my art and go into the movies. hes in tears. felix just looks at him like hes nuts, and shrugs his shoulders. the old guy tells felix to go ye forth and find money to finance a trip to hollywood. felix thinks, how does he expect me to get the money?in minutes, of course (this is a cartoon), he spots a shoe business owner putting up a bankrupt sale on his store. felix comes up with a plan to bail him out and the man promises the cat $500 if it works.well, it does but the man wants to go alone and leave felix at home. in an outrageous scene, felix transforms himself into a briefcase and thats how he gets to hollywood, transforming himself back to cat when they get there.we then witness felixs attempts at getting into show business. his audition scenes are very funny, especially with his imitation of charlie chaplin. in addition there are caricatures of some famous silent film stars and executives. in all, quite a bit of material is in this 9.5- minute cartoon. its amazing how much more you can get in an extra 2.5 minutes, assuming most animated shorts are seven minutes in length.at any rate, there were a number of laughs in here and more zany things you could only see in a cartoon, like felix have a sword duel with giant mosquitoes! crazy stuff.",1
"caution spoiler: at the end of the movie it is announced that the bridge collapsed just a few days after it was captured. the impression is that the attack was all for nothing. in reality, taking the bridge at remagen was the last important victory for the western allies. it was the crossing of the rhine that the allies had been trying to achieve for six months. because the remagen bridge was taken, the war ended in just a few weeks.the bridge only need to last for a day after it was captured. this was enough time for the americans to send combat engineers and a large protective force to the other side, and they could then start building a series of pontoon bridges. the taking of the bridge was a complete success, and meant the that the end of the war was near, and would not last through the summer. contrary to the cynical nature of the film, the victory was heralded with elation by the troops who did it. they knew how vital the battle was.this film has little to do with real history. it was more a reflection of the cynical nature of the time in which it was produced.",0

"i would put death wish 3 in the same box as stallones cobra and commando. the box that i would sell for $2 at a garage sale with all the videos inside. the story is about the main character coming back from the previous movies success to ruin it all with this load of trash. why did the makers want to destroy the reputation of the past 2 films with this cheap junk. the story is so lame that had to be a outrageous sequel. i mentioned cobra earlier because it has the same mood, that one man can kill 20 or 30 gang members without a scratch. both this movie and cobra were bent on showing the hero firing his guns at hip level and the enemy falling in large numbers. police officers spend hours at the shooting range so why did they get gunned down by gang members firing aimlessly from their hips? this movie was so bad i thought for a minute it was death wish 4.",0
"at the bottom end of the apocalypse movie scale is this piece of pish called the final executioner.. at least where i come from. a bloke is trained by an ex-cop to seek vengeance on those that killed his woman and friends in cold blood.. and thats about it. lots of fake explosions and repetitive shootings ensue. has one of the weirdest array of costumes ive seen in a film for a while, and a massive fortress which is apparently only run by 7 people. great job on the dubbing too guys(!) best moment: when our hero loses a swordfight and is about to be skewered through the neck, he just gets out his gun and bang! why not do that earlier? its a mystery. as is why anyone would want to sit through this in the first place. im still puzzling over that one myself now.. 2/10",0
"if you took all the stock elements of a shrek movie (grumpy ogre, annoying donkey, cute kitty, obligatory dance number, etc.), put them in a blender and condensed it to 20 minutes, youd have this mess. painful to watch; i may have laughed once. the story and dialogue are rushed beyond comprehension, with the voice actors sounding like they phoned in their lines. the final reworked rendition of the christmas story poem felt like it was written by a committee in five minutes. and boy, a little eddie murphy goes a long way. with its desperate attempt to be hip and current, this show will be long outdated and forgotten while classics like the grinchâ? will remain timeless. a sad waste of effort by all involved, a veritable jumping of the shark for the shrek franchise.",0

"the filmmaker stayed true to the most accurate account of the story published in 1894 which includes an 1846 manuscript by richard williams bell (son of john and lucy bell and younger brother of betsy bell) titled our family trouble. to knowledge this is the only eyewitness account ever penned. the filmmaker should be credited for accuracy but there is little to say about the production and acting quality. the acting was theatrical and the sound and picture quality was extremely poor. it appears that the filmmaker simply shot scenes of the reported events that took place without incorporating or weaving them into a flowing plot or story line. if you must know the story, read about it, its much more gripping and conclusive.",0

"i saw this movie the day it opened in nyc, at the ziegfield. at the time madonna was not quite the cultural icon she is now. she had a couple of hits, was very good in desparately seeking susan and i had tickets to see her in concert at giants stadium. whos that girl? gives madonna an actual role to play, which is not just a variation of her own personality. she does the madcap/heroine routine better than you might think. griffin dunne is very well cast as the man around to witness all the shenanigans.the story involves a huge cat named murray, a bride-to-be who has slept with every cabbie in nyc, a mean father-in-law, and a key. there are a lot of car chases and cops trailing their path. all the elements of a screwball comedy intact. sir john mills is seen briefly. he shares a glass of champagne with the leads and has the greatest apartment on the upper west side, complete with a rain forest and everything. compared to most madonna movies (the ones ive been able to tolerate anyway), this is fantastic. on its own, its not that bad. 6/10.ps the concert was lousy.",1
"i was pulled into this movie early on, much to my surprise, because i hadnt intended to watch it at all. now i wish i hadnt. the suspense starts out well, with the hit-and-run resulting in death and the question of whether the guilty character will confess, or be found out, or (doable now, though a no-no in the old days of movie-making) get away with it. the plots been done before--what plot hasnt--but the tensions inherent in it, with the additional complications and motivations arising out of the illicit love affair, make for an absorbing first half. then the film abandons the hit-and-run to embark upon a misty exposition of two unrequited, all-suffering loves. the two tracks of plot--hit-and-run and unreasoning love--just dont have enough to do with each other, and that they involve the same characters doesnt bind them enough to justify the departure from the original story line. the screenwriter should have chosen one plot or the other. at the end of the film, in the midst of the movies second funeral, i found myself thinking, now, what does any of this have to do with that hit-and-run? the filmmakers may think the answer obvious, but i think the movie was plotted and executed flabbily.",0

"whats his name? loudon. loudon what? clear.that gag still gets me, twenty one years after the film was released.i loved the film back then and i love it today. i must have watched this a hundred times back in the day, and when i bought the dvd recently i could still remember some of the dialogue.madonna plays nikki finn, a young woman jailed for a crime she didnt commit. when she gets out she decides to seek revenge.griffin dunne (whatever happened to him?), plays an attorney for his fiancã©es father (john mcmartin). the future father-in-law asks loudon to take nikki from prison to the bus station and to make sure she gets on the bus, as part of a supposed new public relations programme. a seemingly easy task, but there are complications aplenty, some funny dialogue, and some admittedly stupid-but-funny scenes along the way.madonna has a stupid voice in this film, which until i was able to watch with subtitles made one or two lines of dialogue incomprehensible for me (hence only 8/10), but on the other hand i cant imagine her doing it in her normal voice.this film shows madonnas comic side (too lacking these days, perhaps), and she genuinely is funny in the role. dunne makes a great foil, while haviland morris is perfect as the uppity fiancã©e.yes, its predictable, yes, the jokes could be better, but i think this is a great film and will happily sit down and watch it 100 times more.",1
"i have never seen so much talent and money used to produce anything so bad in my entire life! as stated in other commentaries, a whos who of talent, such as, christopher plummer, faye dunaway, donald sutherland, and many more were thrown together in a film that is not recognizable as an agatha christie story. i keep thinking of how it could be with the same cast, done the right way. the film has even less intimacy than the christopher reeves superman movies. the large cast makes the slick production even less effective than in those films, because there is not enough time to get to know anyone. dave brubecks progressive jazz soundtrack had me wondering if the wrong video was in the the case from the rental store. the music became more and more offensive as the plot progressed. its hard to say whether the soundtrack or the annoying technique of repeating information from earlier scenes, was more offensive. from someone who has seen most christie films (thats what attracted me to this, it was one of the few i hadnt seen) miss this one. it is not an agatha christie movie. golan-globus are better suited to producing flicks about big time wrestling, rather than the snug atmosphere of english mystery.",0

"even if youre a fan of jean rollins idiosyncratic body of work, you will be caught off guard by this exceptional foray into science fiction territory. for once, theres not a single diaphanously gowned vampire girl in sight ! true to tradition, the budget proved way too tight to realize the directors vision entirely. yet this is largely compensated by his obvious love of genre cinema, dedication to his craft and sheer ingenuity. jean-claude coutys atmospheric cinematography makes the most of the foreboding locations and philippe brã©jean (a/k/a gary sandeur) contributes a startling soundtrack that fortunately doesnt resemble any of the sappy stuff he composed for hardcore.shot in and around a paris office block before and after working hours, the film was largely cast with porn regulars rollin was already quite familiar with from his michel gentil cash-gathering xxx efforts, most notably french f*ck film royalty brigitte lahaie in the demanding lead. playing elisabeth (rather well, i might add), shes picked up wandering a nearby highway one night by robert (vincent gardã¨re), driving home at the end of a long work day. barely able to piece together the string of events that got her there, elisabeth seems to lose her memories mere moments after events occur, even forgetting roberts name and heroic savior role before their night flight comes to an end at his apartment. prior to making love, she rightfully describes herself as a virgin (further credit to brigittes thespian skills that she can handle the line so convincingly, being after all one of the more active adult actresses of the 70s) because she cannot recall a single touch preceding his. because of this nifty bit of context, the relatively long sex scene that follows totally eschews the gratuity of other commercial interludes rollin has had to include in other works to assure funding.when robert leaves for work, hes inevitably erased from elisabeths feeble mind. a mysterious doctor (comedian bernard papineau effectively cast against type) and his menacing assistant solange (striking porn starlet rachel mhas) move in on her during her protectors absence and take her back to the place she turns out to have escaped from. here we get one of the movies strongest scenes as shes re-introduced to her roommate catherine (the late cathã©rine greiner a/k/a hardcore performer cathy stewart in a quietly devastating turn), both girls desperately supplying fictitious shared memories for one another in a bid to outrun their inevitable fate. that deterioration is not solely limited to the mind becomes painfully clear when they are served lunch and catherines unable to control her movements in trying to eat a spoonful of soup. its also catherine who gets to voice the filmmakers compromise with the demands of commerce as she urges elisabeth to get naked and hold her because sex is all they have left now that both mind and physical faculties have deserted them.several rather explicit - if not quite hardcore - sex scenes make up the movies mid-section and french porn aficionados should recognize the likes of alain plumey (a/k/a cyril val), jacques gateau and elodie delage, along with a blink and miss bit from future porno princess marilyn jess whose rape at the hands, mouth and member of plumey was only present in the films rarely screened xxx version filles traquees. the pivotal part of vã©ronique, a girl elisabeth almost seems to remember and whom she seeks to escape anew with, is beautifully handled by the exquisite dominique journet - in her unforgettable debut - who would go on to play a sizable supporting role in franco zeffirellis la traviata. the six feet under ending reveals the deteriorating condition to be the result of a nuclear spill, the quarantined patients ultimately leaving a barely breathing empty shell, unceremoniously disposed off in a fiery furnace. the final shot offers a particularly heartbreaking variation on that of chaplins modern times as elisabeth, approaching complete meltdown by now, and a wounded robert stumble along the railroad bridge, clumsily clasping each others outstretched hands.",1

"the prey has an interesting history, unless you remember the ads for it in newspapers in june of 1984 you might have caught it on the movie channel back in summer 85, but little else is remembered. the plot is your basic killer in the woods again. but ironically this was filmed before friday the 13th. the prey was actually shot sometime in 1978 according to one of the actors in an interview years later. but released for about a week at some drive ins, (yes jim, namans drive in showed this in june of 84). but it has a dated look to it. maybe they released it so later on to cash in on all the other terror films the market was flooded with by 1984. now on the story, it has some kind of back story, a forest fire back in the 1940s leaves a lot of gypsies burned to death. but one of their children survive (our monster) so flash forward to present day which would be 1978, we have an older middle age couple camping only to be dispatched by the monster. the tag line for this picture claims its not human, and its got an axe, but an axe was only used in these first two killings. now we have a bunch of teenagers who look like they in their mid 20s camping. we all know they are the prey, and the monster knocks them of one by one. for an 80 minute movie it seems longer. we also have a lot of wildlife footage to fill in voids for the 80 mins. overall for being out into an 80-s horror movie it looks way more 70s than ever. hey the prey had potential to be a good horror killer in the woods movie but falls a little short.. it does however feature a pretty scary cool looking monster at the end, and we have to wait till the last 2 minutes to see him. side note, the monster has gone on to star in the addams family movies in the 1990s..",0

"warner brothers tampered considerably with american history in big trail director raoul walshs first-rate western they died with their boots on, a somewhat inaccurate but wholly exhilarating biography of cavalry officer george armstrong custer. the film chronicles custer from the moment that he arrives at west point academy until the indians massacre him at the little big horn. this is one of errol flynns signature roles and one of raoul walshs greatest epics. walsh and flynn teamed in quite often afterward, and they died with their boots on reunited olivia de havilland as flynns romantic interest for the last time. they appeared as a couple in seven previous films. this 140-minute, black & white oater is nothing short of brilliant with dynamic action sequences, humorous romantic scenes, and stern dramatic confrontations between our hero and his adversaries. one of the notorious errors involves colonel philip sheridan who is shown as the commandant at west point before the civil war. indeed, sheridan was a lieutenant at this point. in fact, the commandant was robert e. lee as the earlier flynn film santa fe trail showed. another historical lapse concerns lieutenant general whitfield scott; scott was not the commander of union troops throughout the civil war. warner brothers presented custer as a drinker (probably because flynn had a reputation for drinking), but in real life custer neither drank nor smoked. nevertheless, these as well as other historical goofs do not detract from a truly splendid film.they died with their boots on opens with custer riding into west point military academy arrayed in a fancy dress uniform with an african-american carrying his luggage and tending his dogs. after the sergeant of the guard realizes that he has turned out a honor guard for a future plebe instead of a high-ranking foreign general, the sergeant turns custer over to a ranking cadet ned sharp (arthur kennedy of city for conquest) to take charge of him. sharp plays a practical job on custer by installing him in the quarters of major romulus taipe (stanley ridges of task force) who promptly runs custer out. naturally, the volatile custer attacks sharp in a public brawl. general phil sheridan (john litel of the sons of katie elder) is prepared to dismiss custer from west point for conduct unbecoming. as it turns out, sheridan cannot expel custer because custer has not enrolled. once he enrolls, custer establishes a mediocre academic reputation with alacrity to fight and accumulate demerits galore. when the american civil war erupts, west point graduates cadets who have not completed their education and rushes them into combat. one of the last cadets hustled off to war is custer. avid as he is to get into the fight, custer encounters his future wife, elizabeth libby bacon (olivia de havilland of santa fe trail), and they pledge themselves to each other, despite mr. bacon (gene lockhart of carousel) who detests the sight of custer. it seems that bacon ran across custer at a saloon and insulted one of custers friends and our hero reprimanded bacon.meanwhile, back in washington, custer desperately seeks a transfer to a regiment, but major taipe has him cooling his heels. custer befriends rotund lieutenant general winfield scott (sidney greenstreet of the maltese falcon) and they share an appetite for creamed bermuda onions that becomes one of custers characteristics. not only does scott see to it that taipe assigns custer to the second cavalry, but also custer appropriates taipes horse to get to his command. during the battle of bull run, 21 july 1861, custer disobeys orders from none other than sharp, strikes his superior officer and holds a bridge so the infantry can cross it. wounded in the shoulder and sent to the hospital, custer receives a medal rather than a court-martial. when confederate general jeb stuart threatens the union army at the battle of gettysburg, in pennsylvania, scott is shocked by the chance that the south may triumph. when a brigadier general cannot be found, scott goads taipe into promoting the first available officer. a mistake is made and custer is promoted. incredulous at first, custer embraces the moment and cracks stuarts advance. after the war, custer idles down and starts boozing it up with the boys at the local saloons. sharp shows up as a crooked railroad promoter and with his father they try to enlist custer to serve as the president of their railway so that they can obtain funds. eventually, libby intercedes on his behalf with general sheridan, who was in command of the army, and gets him back on active duty as the commander of the 7th cavalry. when he takes command, custer finds the 7th cavalry a drunken lot and is not surprised that sharp commands the liquor at the fort. meanwhile, custer has his first run in with crazy horse (anthony quinn of the guns of navarone) and takes him into custody. of course, crazy horse escapes, becomes custers adversary, and they fight.once custer has quelled crazy horse and the indians, sharp with taipe as a government agent conspire to destroy a peace treaty with the sioux and other indian nations. they also see to it that custer is brought up on charges for striking taipe in a saloon brawl. on his way to washington, custer discovers the perfidy of sharp and taipe who have drummed up a gold strike in the sacred black hills. settlers rampage in and the indians hit the warpath. custer sacrifices himself and his 600 men at the little big horn in a slam-bang showdown against 6000 redskins. stagecoach lenser bert glennon captures both the grit and the glory. the long shot of the 7th cavalry leaving the fort at dawn is spectacular. as an added premonition of custers imminent demise, libby faints after he leaves their quarters for the little big horn. they died with their boots on benefits from a top-notch max steiner score that incorporates the regimental tune gary owen.",1
"if you keep rigid historical perspective out of it, this film is actually quite entertaining. its got action, adventure and romance, and one of the premiere casting match-ups of the era with errol flynn and olivia de havilland in the lead roles. as evident on this board, the picture doesnt pass muster with purists who look for one hundred percent accuracy in their story telling. to get beyond that, one need only put aside the history book, and enjoy the story as if it were a work of fiction. i know, i know, thats hard to do when you consider custers last stand at the little big horn and its prominence in the history of post civil war america. so i guess theres an unresolved quandary with the picture, no matter how you look at it.theres a lot to take in here though for the pictures two hour plus run time. custers arrival at west point is probably the first head scratcher, riding up as he does in full military regalia. the practical joke by sharp (arthur kennedy) putting him up in the majors headquarters probably should have gotten them both in trouble.ironically, a lot of scenes in this military film play for comedy, as in custers first meeting with libby bacon, and subsequent encounters that include tea reader callie (hattie mcdaniel). i hadnt noticed it before in other films, but mcdaniel reminded me an awful lot of another favorite character actor of mine from the forties, mantan moreland. so much so that in one scene it looked like it might have been moreland hamming it up in a dress. with that in mind, the owl scene was a hoot too.as for flynn, its interesting to note that a year earlier, he portrayed j.e.b. stuart opposite ronald reagans depiction of general custer in santa fe trail, both vying for the attention of none other than olivia de havilland. in that film, reagan put none of the arrogance and flamboyance into the character of custer that history remembers, while in flynns portrayal here its more than evident. but it doesnt come close to that of richard mulligans take on the military hero in 1970s little big man. lets just say that one was a bit over the top.the better take away the picture had for me was the manner in which custer persevered to maintain his good name and not gamble it away on a risky business venture. that and his loyalty to the men he led in battle along with the discipline he developed over the course of the story. most poignant was that final confrontation with arch rival sharp just before riding into the little big horn, in which he declared that hell or glory was entirely dependent on ones point of view. earlier, a similar remark might have given us the best insight of all into custers character, when he stated - you take glory with you when its your time to go.",1
i would like to comment on how the girls are chosen. why is that their are always more white women chosen then their are black women. every episode their is always more white women then black ones. as if to say white women are better looking then black women. i would like for once see more black women then white. and it not just your show its like that in a lot of shows always more whites. but i would have thought since you as the head honcho of the show you would see this yourself and have more black women on your show. but you are just like the rest trying to act like you are so fair and nice. you are just a big fony hypocrite.,0
"why does everyone feel they have to constantly put this movie down? it is cute and funny (exactly what it is meant to be). madonna wasnt out to prove herself as an oscar calliber artist with this movie anyhow! she was just doing what the character called for, and she did it well. i loved her in this movie; it is my second favorite madonna movie after evita. the soundtrack is excellent too. it is no better or no worse than any cheesy 80s flick. to all the critics, just dont take it so seriously and you might have fun watching it. madonna is a goddess!!!",1
"watching this little movie is a sheer delight from start to finish. the story is always entertaining, the tension never loosing up. the whole cast is wonderful. the teaming of walken and bracco works to perfection, it is almost like an echo of a classic screwball romance. bracco is very sexy and really funny as the scam artist who fights for her independence. for some reason they gave walken a very strange make up and the weirdest haircut i can imagine â? its sort of a parody of the one burt lancaster had in elmer gantry. for me it added to the pleasure. its the first movie i saw miguel ferrer in, probably one of the most under-appreciated movie actors of his generation. hes very good in a small role as braccos pimp. even the jamaican thugs are a sight to behold. i can highly recommend this movie.",1
"naturally, along with everyone else, i was primed to expect a lot of hollywood fantasy revisionism in they died with their boots on over the legend of custer. just having someone like errol flynn play custer is enough of a clue that the legend has precedence over the truth in this production. and for the most part my expectations were fulfilled (in an admittedly rousing and entertaining way).yet even in this obviously biased (and much criticized) retelling of the custer story, i was struck by some of the points made in this movie that, sometimes subtly but nevertheless solidly, seemed to counter the typical clichã©s of manifest destiny and unvarnished heroism usually found in westerns of the early 20th century.for instance, even while this film attempted to whitewash its hero, certain scenes still suggested the more flawed and foolish character of the real-life custer: 1) his initial entrance at the west point front gate, in which his arrogance and pompousness is a clear aspect of his character.2) his miserable record at west point, which seems to be attributed as much to custers cluelessness about the demands of military service as any other factor; there are moments in the way flynn plays custer at west point where he seems downright stupid.3) custers promotion to general is not only presented as a ridiculous mistake, but it plays out as slapstick comedy. i half-expected to see the marx brothers or abbott and costello wander into the scene.4) custers stand against jeb stuart at gettysburg is not whitewashed as brilliant military tactical leadership, but is presented as reckless and wildly lucky.5) custers drinking problem is certainly not ignored.and although the music and some of the ways the indians were shown in this film were certainly reinforcements of the racist stereotype of the ignorant savage, it still came as a surprise to me that the movie actually went into some detail as to why the indians were justified in attacking the whites who were moving into their land, and fairly explicitly laid the blame for the battles in the black hills squarely at the foot of the white man. in fact, no one can argue that the clear villain of the piece is not anthony quinn as sitting bull, but arthur kennedy & co. as the white devils making the false claim of gold in the black hills. sure, that part of the story is true, but i didnt expect to see it portrayed quite so unequivically in a movie like this.and one other thing: usually in these films it is the indians who are portrayed en masse as drunken animals seemingly incapable of the basic common sense to avoid getting falling down drunk any time they get near alcohol. in this movie, it is actually the troops of the 7th cavalry, and not the indians, who in at least two scenes are portrayed this way.all in all, this movie slips in some surprising moments in the midst of the hollywood bunk.",1
in addition to the fact that this is just an abysmally made film (imagine giving a camcorder to the average high school drama club) the people who think that there is anything real about this legend need to grow up. this is the 21st century. guess what: ghosts dont exist. most people learn that from their mother when theyre about 5 years old. you guys seriously need to grow up.the fact that a fraud was perpetrated nearly 2 centuries ago does not make it any less a fraud. the fact that a large number of inbred hillbillies from tennessee believe it doesnt do it either. go to college. or at least finish high school.,0

"this tale of the upper-classes getting their come-uppance and wallowing in their high-class misery is like a contemporary mid-sommerish version of an old joan crawford movie in which she suffered in mink. here, people behave in a frightfully civilized manner in the face of adversity. a well-heeled london solicitor, (tom wilkinson), discovers that not only is his wife having an affair with the local gentry but that she has also killed their housekeepers husband in a hit-and-run accident. he throws up, but otherwise his stiff-upper-lip hardly quavers.written and directed by julian fellowes, who won an oscar for writing gosford park, (this is his directorial debut), from a novel by nigel balchin, its quite comical although i am not sure how much of the comedy is intended. its like a throw-back to british films of the forties where characters all behaved like characters in books or plays rather than like people might in real life. however, its not all bad. wilkinson is terrific, even if you never believe in him as a person while emily watson, (the adulterous wife), and rupert everett, (the highly amoral high-class totty), are both very good at covering the cracks in the material. tony pierce-roberts cinematography ensures that no matter how hard it is on the ear its always good on the eye.",0
"when i see a movie, i usually seek entertainment. but of course if i know what genre the move is, then i will seek what it is meant to do. for example, if it is a deep film, i expect the film to rile thoughts up in my cranium and make me ponder what it is saying. but whos that girl? is not a deep film. but it is entertaining, nonetheless. its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch. theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts. ive watched it when i was younger. the cast is always entertaining as usual. i had a small crush on griffin dunne even though he wasnt the typical male heartthrob at the time. haviland morris also stars. and late austrian actress bibi besch is here too! overall, a delight!",1
"how sad it is when a film as wonderful as jurassic park slowly nosedives into hackneyed and mediocre territory throughout its franchise. the newest sequel, jurassic park iii, has given no thought to characters, a story, or pretty much a script, and instead relies on non-stop dinosaur action, which is neither thrilling nor very interesting to watch. the dinosaurs seemed to look incredibly fake compared to the 1993 technology, after 7 years of cgi advancements, it only gives you more of the feeling that the film was pumped out for the summer relying only on its name. the introduction of a pterodactyl does not a great movie make.go see shrek again.",0
"wealthy horse ranchers in buenos aires have a long-standing no-trading policy with the crawfords of manhattan, but what happens when the mustachioed latin son falls for a certain crawford with bright eyes, blonde hair, and some perky moves on the dance floor? 20th century-fox musical has a glossy veneer yet seems a bit tatty around the edges. it is very heavy on the frenetic, gymnastic-like dancing, exceedingly thin on story. betty grable (an eleventh hour replacement for alice faye) gives it a boost, even though shes paired with leaden don ameche (in tan make-up and slick hair). also good: charlotte greenwood as bettys pithy aunt, a limousine driver whos constantly asleep on the job, and carmen miranda playing herself (who else?). the stock shots of argentina far outclass the action filmed on the fox backlot, and some of the supporting performances are quite awful. by the time of the big horserace finale, most viewers will have had enough. *1/2 from ****",0

"this was a great movie! it was a completely enjoyable adolescent fantasy. so what makes a movie great? technical details? i think that if that were the sole criteria, our culture would be the poorer for it. so this movie is to the godfather as new wave music is to mozart. the point is, it is one of the best movies of its type ive seen. the women are all beautiful (as are only seen on california beaches when movies are being made). it has a little of everything, a kind of battlestar gallactica meets baywatch meets the playboy centerfold video meets waynes world. there is plenty of charm and a reasonable (albeit predictable) storyline that keeps you interested until the next bit of eye candy graces the screen. joe estevez may not have his brothers career, but does a good job of bringing focus to the story as the eternally adolescent uncle bud. contains plenty of expected absurdities such as female rock band playing without the guitars plugged in.

"its strange how the least known movies sometimes end up amongst the best youve seen. this movie has all the elements of a standard modern day thriller, guns, techno, baddies, cash, etc, and yet it stands out from your average hollywood also-ran. i would credit this to two very charismatic people. christopher walken has a cool confidence and lorraine bracco is one of the warmest and sexiest women ive ever seen on screen. another major reason why this film stands out is coz the setting shifts to jamaica after the beginning. the jamaican resort is so beautiful youll wish you were there sitting by the pool at night, with a runncoke. . . .i know i did. im very glad i saw this movie - it was just too nice to miss!",1

"all the criticisms of this movie are quite valid! it is pretty boring, and filled with all kinds of pointless ridiculous stuff. a couple exchanging nods over their good grub. a medium shot of a desk as a phone rings until someone finally comes, sits down, and answers it at a pretty leisurely pace. quadruple-takes or more when people look at things. solitary banjo-tuning and playing, taking a break for a beer. telling a joke to a fawn, about a big-mouthed frog trying to learn what to feed its babies, complete with many big-mouthed expressions (which are needed for the weak punchline). the sharing of cucumber and cream cheese sandwiches on oatmeal bread, which to the squeamish become unpalatable when theres talk of people burned in a fire. lots of seemingly stock-footage close-up shots of animals, birds, insects, and spiders in the woods.the movie starts with a forest fire, then at least a couple decades later some people in those same woods get killed by an axe. the killer evidently wasnt too satisfied by the axe he stole, and kills other people with other weapons of opportunity or his bare hands.if its true that the movie in the version available on the out-of-print videotape is cut, perhaps if theres a lot of footage that was cut, it deserves another look on dvd. otherwise, its simply not very interesting, and would probably try the patience of even the most hardcore outdoors-slasher fan.",0
"can you capture the moment? when first you hear rain on a roof? some things are beyond the sum of their parts, expressing the poetry of life. the things that matter.poet dylan thomas captured the seemingly inexpressible a good poem helps to . . . extend everyones knowledge, of himself and the world around him. (bob dylan named himself after him). so why has it taken so long to make a film of the great dylan thomas? a simple biopic could have missed the point. writer sharman macdonald has taken a different, better approach.in the edge of love, she creates the world of passions and complexities that fill the poems so we can swim in them. the lives of four friends. dylan, who lusts and loves to the full. wife caitlin (sienna miller), his feisty support. war-hero william (cillian murphy), who saves him from a street brawl. and then theres his childhood sweetheart. vera. dear vera. take your breath away vera. shes caitlins closest friend. williams wife. and, like a muse, the star in dylans dark sky.it all kicks off in the 1940 london blitz, with bomb shelters in the underground. enter vera (an impressive keira knightley) under makeshift stage spotlights. she meets dylan for the first time again in years, her heart is flushed. their eyes shine through the smoke of the room. the purity of their former passion. dylan (native welsh-speaker, matthew rhys) is no sanctified, sanitised poet. master of his vices he must experience them all fully. he introduces his beloved wife then continues to woo vera.the edge of love is a visual treat. the soundtrack leaves you wanting for more. performances are possibly the best by these actors in their careers. as a lush love story its pretty good. as an insight into dylan thomas and the reality of poetry in all our lives, not bad at all. and as a tribute to a great man, inspiring.the production has been at pains to project the spirit of dylan thomas without compromising historical accuracy too much. dramatic tension involves a pull between artistic freedom and conventional morality. audiences looking for an experience based on the latter may be disappointed. and it will play less well to audiences whose boundaries are those of albert square.sharman macdonald seemed aware of the headstrong nature of artistic freedom and its limits when she spoke to producer rebekah gilbertson (granddaughter of the real william and vera). think of all the things that you dont want me to write about, she said, because i have to have carte blanche. for macdonald, the limits were if she should cause offence to dylans memory. but for many artists, especially men, the limits are those which wife and family could set on them. a woman is not going to let lofty ideals interfere with practical common sense issues, and will even put her childrens interests before her own (this occasionally happens the other way round, as when towering genius virginia woolf refused to let loving leonard bring her down to earth - in the hours).in spite of the tension between caitlin and vera, these two women become closest buddies. it is one of the main (and very beautiful) themes of the film.the films colours tell a story in themselves. in a drab, wartime britain, caitlin and vera are vivid highlights in an ocean of grey. shortly after meeting veras lit-up-in-lights stage persona, we encounter caitlin through her searing blue eyes, sparkling in a darkened railway carriage. her dramatic red coat cuts a dash through streets of colourless homogeneity, triumphing on a beautiful staircase as she reunites with dylan. but veras lipstick red brightness is less enduring. for her, marriage is second-best, even when she has become possessed with genuine love for her husband.outstanding cinematography extends to using montage to juxtapose images, in a manner similar to poetrys juxtaposition of unrelated words to create further meaning. horrific war scenes in thessaly are intercut with screams of vera in pregnancy. giving birth or is it abortion? we are not told immediately. pain is universal and goes beyond time and place to our present day.constant echoes of dylans poetry throughout the film lead us beyond earthly opposites. it reminds me of marlon brando reading ts eliot in apocalypse now. a light beyond the horrors of the world. a different way of seeing things. ill take you back to a time when no bombs fell from the sky and no-one died â? ever, says dylan to vera as they walk along the beach. elsewhere, caitlin recalls childhood with vera: were still innocent in dylan, she says.theres a time to leave your knickers at home or share a universal cigarette. (not literally, perhaps.) a time to be inspired. enjoy what is possibly the best british film of the year.",1

"i have certainly not seen all of jean rollins films, but they mostly seem to be bloody vampire naked women fests, which if you like that sort of thing is not bad, but this is a major departure and could almost be cronenberg minus the bio-mechanical nightmarish stuff. except its in french with subtitles of course. a man driving on the road at night comes across a woman that is in her slippers and bathrobe and picks her up, while in the background yet another woman lingers, wearing nothing. as they drive along its obvious that there is something not right about the woman, in that she forgets things almost as quickly as they happen. still though, that doesnt prevent the man from having sex with her once they return to paris & his apartment. the man leaves for work and some strangers show up at his place and take the woman away to this tower block, a huge apartment building referred to as the black tower, where others of her kind (for whom the no memory things seems to be the least of their problems) are being held for some reason. time and events march by in the movie, which involve mostly trying to find whats going on and get out of the building for this woman, and she does manage to call robert, the guy that picked her up in the first place, to come rescue her. the revelation as to whats going on comes in the last few moments of the movie, which has a rather strange yet touching end to it. in avoiding what seemed to be his typical formula, rollin created, in this, what i feel is his most fascinating and disturbing film. i like this one a lot, check it out. 8 out of 10.",1
"[contains spoilers!!!] garfield and his owner jon arbuckle were in a rut. they basically had no life at all. all they did was lay around and count the ceiling tiles. jon even organized his sock drawer according to color and fabric. he needed a life. so he consults a book on the subject that tells him to meet a woman. a singles bar was a great place to start. unfortunately, when the music started and jon hit the dance floor, we see what made disco die: jon killed it. jon next tried to pick up girls at the video store. he ended up feeling down in the mouth. literally. the laundromat was no prize either when jon and his would-be date get a glimpse of each others underwear. jon tried to act all buff at the beach, but soon he angered a real buff guy, which left jon feeling, once again, down in the mouth. literally. jon then tried to pick up girls walking and jogging by. no avail. jon pulled out a guitar and sings the blues. unfortunately when he mentioned his cat being fat, a fat man walked up and stomped jons guitar. it was hopeless. fortunately for jon, an ad flashed on the tv: an ad for lorenzos school for the personality impaired. it guaranteed a lifeless person to get a life in a few easy steps. jon and garfield attend the class. the building didnt exactly look the same way it did on tv, nor did lorenzo act as peppy as he did on tv. jon sat next to a pretty girl named mona. so while lorenzo taught his lessons of introducing yourself, checking your pulse, and pretending to speak a foreign language, jon and mona get to know one another. they leave together, forgetting all about garfield. at home, jon and mona just sat on the porch and talked. garfield was jealous of mona for fear that she would take jon away from him. garfield envisioned the future: jon and mona get married, she moves in, and soon she gives birth to a little arbuckle who is overjoyed at pulling garfields tale. back to the present, garfield would not stand for it. he tried to get jon to get rid of mona, until she started scratching behind his ears. but then jon learned that mona was allergic to cats. so that was basically the end of their relationship. but they still saw each other every now and then, and garfield was sure to be with them. another hilarious garfield tv special! this one was made during the run of tvs garfield and friends. garfield was slimmed down somewhat. somewhat. since hie early 1980s cartoons. the scenes of jon trying to pick up chicks is funny, so is the one where the fat guy stomps on jons guitar. good ol lorenzo music is back as garfield. thom huge is jon. frank welker (the third man of 1,000 voices) is lorenzo. and june foray (the woman of 1,000 voices) is mona. if you like garfield, then i recommend you see garfield gets a life today! it, along with here comes garfield, and garfield on the town, were just released on dvd! so check them all out today! you are guaranteed a good time. hey, has garfield ever let you down before?-",1
"i must say, every time i see this movie, i am deeply touched, not only by the most painful four years of hongshengs life, but also by how his family deals with his drug addiction. it is also true that getting addicted to anything, such as drugs, alcohol, or pornography, cannot only hurt you, but also hurt your most important people in the world: your family. since family is the #1 priority in the asian culture, it takes guts for the circle to gather together and show one person how much the family loves him/her. this is actually the first chinese movie that i actually enjoy, not for the fun of it, but the elements surrounding it (superb acting, touching story, great direction) make this movie worth watching. what stands out the most is that hongsheng and his family act out the story themselves instead of having some b-movie actor trying to imitate the real person. it shows the genuineness of the movie.",1

"whether one views him as a gallant cavalier of the plains or a glory hunting egomaniac, debates about the life and military career of george armstrong custer continue down to the present day. they died with their boots on presents certain facts of the custer story and has taken liberty with others.he did in fact graduate at the bottom of his class at west point and got this overnight promotion on the battlefield to brigadier general. his record leading the michigan regiment under his command was one of brilliance.it was also true that his marriage to libby bacon was one of the great love matches of the 19th century. libby and george were married for 12 years until the little big horn. whats not known to todays audience is that libby survived until 1933. during that time she was the custodian of the custer legend. by dint of her own iron will and force of personality her late husband became a hero because she would not allow him to be remembered in any other way.i think raoul walsh and warner brothers missed a good opportunity to have the custer career told in flashback. olivia dehavilland should have been made up the way jeanette macdonald was in maytime, and be telling the story of her husband and her marriage from the point of view of nostalgia and remembrance. even then the cracks in the custer legend were appearing, but if done from libbys point of view, they could be understood and forgiven.sydney greenstreet gave a fine performance as general winfield scott. the only problem was that scott had nothing whatsoever to do with custer, he was retired and replaced by george b. mcclellan in late 1861 while custer was still at west point. im not sure they ever met. but greenstreet does a good characterization of the ponderous and powerful winfield scott. a nice mexican war story should have been what they gave greenstreet instead for his very accurate portrayal of old fuss and feathers.the film though is carried by one of the great romantic teams of cinema, errol flynn and olivia dehavilland. this was the last of eight films they did together. the last scene they ever did for the cameras was libbys farewell to george as he leaves to join his regiment for what will prove to be his last campaign. both their performances, olivias especially, was a high point in their careers at warner brothers. we know through history that custer is riding to his doom, that and the fact that this was their last screen teaming give this scene such a special poignancy. if your eyes dont moisten you are made of marble. as history they died with their boots on leaves a lot to be desired. as western adventure that successfully mixes romance with the action, you cant beat this film at all.",1
"this is a cut above other movies of the genre: genuinely suspenseful, intelligent, brilliantly acted and visually stunning. yes, the plot can be confusing - but thats partly what makes it pack such a punch. watch it twice if you can. youll get almost as much out of watching it when you know the twist than you do from watching it the first time.dont be put off by the fact that this film comes from korea, a country not too familiar to most western audiences. while there are elements of the film that are culturally specific, the underlying themes are all too universal - guilt, anger, loss, madness and retribution. all of these are handled superbly by lim su-jeong as su-mi, the lead character. also worthy of particular mention is yum jung-ah, who delivers a deeply creepy and unsettling performance as the stepmother. while it has its scary moments, this is not really a horror flick as most people would imagine it. its more a psychological suspense story with an element of mystery. it grips you from the start and will keep you guessing until the end - and possibly beyond!",1

"brass pictures (movies is not a fitting word for them) really are somewhat brassy. their alluring visual qualities are reminiscent of expensive high class tv commercials. but unfortunately brass pictures are feature films with the pretense of wanting to entertain viewers for over two hours! in this they fail miserably, their undeniable, but rather soft and flabby than steamy, erotic qualities non withstanding.senso 45 is a remake of a film by luchino visconti with the same title and alida valli and farley granger in the lead. the original tells a story of senseless love and lust in and around venice during the italian wars of independence. brass moved the action from the 19th into the 20th century, 1945 to be exact, so there are mussolini murals, men in black shirts, german uniforms or the tattered garb of the partisans. but it is just window dressing, the historic context is completely negligible.anna galiena plays the attractive aristocratic woman who falls for the amoral ss guy who always puts on too much lipstick. she is an attractive, versatile, well trained italian actress and clearly above the material. her wide range of facial expressions (signalling boredom, loathing, delight, fear, hate ... and ecstasy) are the best reason to watch this picture and worth two stars. she endures this basically trashy stuff with an astonishing amount of dignity. i wish some really good parts come along for her. she really deserves it.",0

(the caddy is hilarious and motivational and steals every scene he appears in.) but despite these handicaps, francis displays courage, spirit, heroism, and humility at this world class event.and, we learn a lot about the early years of golf; for example, the use of small wooden clubs, the layout of the short holes, the manual scoreboard, the golfers swinging with pipes in their mouths, the terrible conditions of the greens and fairways, and the play not being canceled even in torrential rain.this film has stunning cinematography and art direction and editing. and with no big movie stars, the story is somehow more believable.this adds to the inventory of great sports movies in the vein of miracle and remember the titans.fyi - there is a truly moving pictures web site where there is a listing of past winners going back 70 years.",1
if anyone tells you this picture is just terrific they probably have something to do with either making it or profiting from it. this film is a real loser and it copies situations from big budget horror movies and not to mention soundtracks to. i wouldnt recommend this one to my worst enemy. it is a low budget movie with amateur actors. it looks like it was filmed for a film contest. the acting is terrible and it wouldnt surprise me if the script was written by a hee haw script writer. my family laughed at it. a grade zzzzzzzzzzzzz all the way. you wont be scared by this one. here is one little taste of the terrible elements of this film. when the guy gets his toe stomped by ric whites stupid portrayal of the reverend james johnston walking cane. the guys reactions are like if he had an amputation with no pain killer. watch the dvd extras after you watch the movie. when you see ric white and others talk so seriously about the movie you will laugh till your stomach hurts. how people will stretch the truth and what they will do to earn a dishonest buck. dont get fooled like we did and buy this failure.,0
"first of all i hate those moronic rappers, who couldnt act if they had a gun pressed against their foreheads. all they do is curse and shoot each other and acting like clichã©e version of gangsters.the movie doesnt take more than five minutes to explain what is going on before were already at the warehouse there is not a single sympathetic character in this movie, except for the homeless guy, who is also the only one with half a brain.bill paxton and william sadler are both hill billies and sadlers character is just as much a villain as the gangsters. i didnt like him right from the start.the movie is filled with pointless violence and walter hills specialty: people falling through windows with glass flying everywhere. there is pretty much no plot and it is a big problem when you root for no-one. everybody dies, except from paxton and the homeless guy and everybody get what they deserve.the only two black people that can act is the homeless guy and the junkie but theyre actors by profession, not annoying ugly brain dead rappers.stay away from this crap and watch 48 hours 1 and 2 instead. at lest they have characters you care about, a sense of humor and nothing but real actors in the cast.",0
"george armstrong custer is known through history as an inept general who led his rgiment to their death at the battle of little big horn. they died with their boots on, paints a different picture of general custer. in this movie he is portrayed as a flamboyant soldier whose mistakes, and misdeeds are mostly ue to his love for adventure.errol flynn plays george armstrong custer who we first meet as an over confident recruit at west point. custer quickily distinguishes himself from other cadets as beeing a poor student who always seems to be in trouble. somehow this never appears to bother custer and only seems to confuse him as he genuinely does not know how he gets into such predicaments. in spite of his poor standing, he eventualy graduates and becomes an officer in the united states army. through an error, custer receives a promotion in rank. before this can be corrected, he leads a union regiment into battle against the confederates. his campaign is successful and custer becomes an unlikely national hero. custer returns to his hometown, marries his sweetheart, libby who is played by olivia de havilland. libby is a very supportive understanding wife who steadfastly stays by his side and follows him into the frontier as he assumes leadership of the seventh regiment of the cavalry. custer becomes a man of honor who strives to keep peace with the native americans. to prove his intentions, he enters into a treaty with crazy horse, the leader of the sioux . when that treaty is jeopardized by a conspiracy to spread a false rumor of gold being found in the black hills, custer sacrifices his own life as well as the lives of the men under his command to prevent the slaughter of thousands of innocent settlers.errol flynn dominates each scene in which he appears. he successfully portrays custer as being flamboyant, arrogant, romantic and funny depending on the mood of the scene. olivia de havillands depiction of libby bacon custer as the love of his life lets us see his tender, more gentle side. the chemistry between dehavilland and flynn, who had acted together in several other movies, is so smooth and it almost makes the viewer feel like they are playing themselves and not the parts of custer and his wife. the other actors portrayals of their characters truly enhance the performances of flynn and de havilland. anthony quinn as crazy horse, sidney greenstreet as general winfield scott , arthur kennedy as edward sharp are among the other actors whose roles have made this movie entertaining.the reviewer would rate this a 4 star movie. while it is not historically accurate, it is very entertaining. the movie has a little bit of everything. it has adventure, comedy and romance, so it appeals to a large variety of audiences. the casting of the characters is excellent and the actors give believable performances which makes you forget it is largely based on fiction instead of fact. the reviewer especially likes that the native americans were not shown to be the bad guys but just showed them as wanting to protect their sacred land.",1
"the bridge at remagen contains some of the most preposterous war time screenplay ive ever seen. aside from the acting, which is wooden, no tank commander attacks with his tanks parked in nice neat rows, up the middle of roads, and with troops bunched all together with their arms not at the ready. the constant suicidal behavior set off my tilt switch so often i found it impossible to enjoy the movie. apparently the screen writers and director have never been through actual warfare and never bothered to bring in an expert who had. this movie is the very antithesis of the excellent detail in saving private ryan. unless you are under 7 years old, i recommend watching something else.gb",0
"three businessmen are involved in a bar fight with three mysterious men. the three businessmen take revenge, which escalates to a murder after another. supposedly the story is about the violence that could happen to ordinary people.the plot has too many holes. the details were ignored in order to move the story forward. the acting was uneven. the color balance was awful even though i watched this movie in dvd. the small budget and tight schedule were apparent. the whole thing seems to be an excuse to shoot the final gun fight, and the ending was just unbelievable.",0
"when one stops to recollect upon the frequent on screen teaming of errol flynn and olivia dehavilland, they died with their boots on (1941) is most likely the film remembered best. it is the sweeping saga of general custer (flynn) - told from the time he enters west point military academy and falls for the luscious elizabeth bacon (dehavilland), through his tenure during the american civil war, and finally with his death at little big horn. director, raoul walsh mounts his historical epic on the laurels of highly questionable recanting of historical texts, rewritten by screen writers wally kline and aeneas mackenzie, until truth and fiction are warped all out of proportion. hence, the battle against chief crazy horse (anthony quinn) is portrayed as a crooked deal between politicians - california joe (charley grapewin) and a spuriously absent corporation which wants to reclaim the land custer gave to the indians through the systematic genocide of the nations first peoples. flynn, who cleverly plays custer as though he is one part arnold schwartzenegger to two parts albert schweitzer, has never been more ignoble. he literally oozes charm and sex appeal from every pore that easily melts the heart of his loyal heroine. resident warner stock players, arthur kennedy and sidney greenstreet deliver marvelous cameos that appear to have far more depth and character than is actually written into the material for them.overall, then, despite its loose rendering of history in favor of a good romantic yarn, they died with their boots on is ample film fodder for a saturday matinã©e or sunday night cooing with ones sweetheart. warners dvd is pretty nice looking. although film grain is often obvious, the gray scale has been very nicely rendered with deep, solid blacks and very clean whites. some fading is obvious during scene transitions. the audio has been very nicely cleaned up and is presented at an adequate listening level.",1
"disgused as an asian horror, a tale of two sisters is actually a complex character driven psychological drama, that engulfs the viewer into the problems of a seemingly normal family. i was really surprised at the depth of this movie. director ji-woon kims decision to focus more on telling a story rather than providing cheap scares, has proved a correct one. creating one of the most ingenious new horror movies.a tale of two sisters tels the story, as its name suggest of two sisters su-mi and the younger su-yeon, who after spending time in a mental institution return home to their father and apparently abusive stepmother. from then on we witness how the sisters deal with their stepmothers gradually rising aggression and erratic behavior. to say what would happen next would be to be spoil the entire experience. so ill just leave it at that.the plot is very tightly written. with the characters nicely fleshed out. ji-woon kims focus on a small cast offers a much more detailed view on them and their relations to one another. furthermore each of the four main cast has a vastly different role and type of character. from the protective su-mi, the weaker su-yeon, the visibly uninterested father to the stepmothers frantic and later deadly behavior. there is great sense of mystery, with a lot of the plot not revealed up into the end and even after that the movie still leaves a great room for interpretation. even after watching it once, the viewer will be compelled to see it at least once more so that he can gain a better understanding to it.the actors superbly fit their roles. it is especially hard to create strong, emotional scenes in psychological movies but it is a great joy when one succeeds in creating them and this is a prime example of such a feat. ji-woon kims direction is slow paced and gripping, building up tension for the films horroresque scenes. while few in number those moments are strong and quite frankly terrifying. the cinematography and score are top notch further helping to establish an atmosphere fitting that of a psychological film.a tale of two sisters is a demonstration how the horror genre is in fact so much more than a simple thrill ride. with its strong focus on character and mystery this is one complex movie that could easily seduce you in watching it again and again just so that you can understand it better.",1
"dont listen to what the critics have always said about this cute, charming little movie. madonna is great in this clever comedy. i worked at a video store for several years and suggested this movie to lots of customers- no one ever brought it back and screamed at me for telling them to rent it. everyone always enjoyed it. its actually a great movie for kids, too.",1
"(a possible minor spoiler) the first jurassic park was an effective, but silly film that did its job and was actually pretty good. the sequel the lost world had a few decent moments, but those were ruined by the lame end portion of the film which had a t-rex running amok in san diego. now in jurassic park iii, what little story there was in the first one and the sequel, has been thrown out the window and replaced by a mere 90 minutes of basically non-stop action, which would have worked had the film not been so poorly done.sam neill is back as dr. grant, who is given a proposition by a couple (william h. macy & tea leoni) to come with them to an island to help them find their son, whos been lost for over 2 months. but of course this island just happens to be populated by dinosaurs and of course the plane the are on just happens to crash leaving them stranded with a bunch of dinos after them.this one was obviously intended as a thrill ride, with no real story whatsoever, but even on that level the movie doesnt deliver. director joe johnston (jumanji) somehow managed to take what little magic was left in the jurassic movies and squeeze the life right out of it. the dinos look okay, though by now theyre just standard fair and not very scary. the bottom line is its not a very good film, even as a thrill ride. * out of 4 stars.",0
"this is awesome!!! there is no partnership quite like errol, and olivia. there love is genuine! im 24, yet this flick is as captivating now as im sure it was 60 years ago. raoul walsh is an under-rated genius, his direction is so sweeping, so broad, yet so intimate. the last scene between colonel custer (flynn), and his wife (de havilland), almost brought me to tears (not easy for a 24yr old guy!!), its so heart-wrenching. there is also a deep christian message implicit here, the faith custer has in taking your glory with you, and the trust, and fidelity of his wife to the extent of letting him go, in order that he fulfils his moral duty to protect the innocent civilians from certain massacre. there is no movie that deals with these issues quite like this. a must-see for anyone who wants to look at this defining moment in american, and military history, from the inside. patriotic, for all the right reasons. i knew errol flynn was a star, and de havilland was a screen legend-this only confirms my suspicions that they are among the very greatest!",1
"now this is more like it!one of the best movies i have ever seen!despite it made very well on all aspects,this movie was put down solely for not being too historically accurate.loosen up!there are tons of historical movies out there that were forgiven for not being too historically accurate and many of them do not even come close to how grand,how entertaining and how captivating this movie was!now this is what a movie ticket is all about!you will get exacty what you want from this movies genre and all naysayers are those with the anti-flynn syndrome.this conservative rooted syndrome is very closely related to the anti-elvis,anti-ali,anti-clinton,anti-kennedy syndromes,usually caused by fear of charming individuals who have unconventional beliefs.if the viewer of this movie is open minded and has the ability to separate politics from art,you will find this movie not only one of the best classics,but also one of the best movies of all time.i rate it the second best western ever, right behind waynes the cowboys........",1
"if this film had been made in the 50s or 60s, critics and fans alike would have praised it. i myself, enjoyed the film from beginning to end. its not a timeless piece, and has not aged well over the years, but it is enjoyable to watch, nonetheless. as for mrs. ritchies acting in the film? not the best on the planet -- but it adds to the films unique slapstick comedy-aspirations, and showcases madonnas (often underrated) sense of comedic timing. madonna plays nikki finn, an ex-convict who was framed for a crime she didnt commit. griffin dunne plays the hapless future groom/puppet who is sent to escort her from prison to the bus station, where a series of unfortunate events occurs, thus creating the plot. (and there *is* one, folks!) give the film a shot. you might be pleasantly surprised at how funny it really is.",1
"while the premise of the film sounded unique and intriguing after watching the first 5 minutes of the film i could have stopped there and gone on with my life. she does get some interesting comments and reactions from her subjects, but not really enough to add to the validity of the film.i also felt she went a bit overboard with many things. if a guy said a filthy comment, grabbed her, or made some disgusting gesture to her, i would say go for it, bring him down, hes a pig. what bothered me though is she would walk around in revealing clothes and be surprised when guys would look at her and give them hell about it.i think somehow she forgot that being attracted to other people is a part of human sexuality and a big part of who we all are. guys will look at beautiful women, especially when they dress provocatively, just like women will look at men when they are wearing a tight tank or no shirt at all.some women may hate me for this, but i hope not. i have much respect for women. i was raised by one. i also come from a spanish family and we are very matriarchal. my grandmother was the center of my family for years, but i dont really feel this did anything to help womens rights and from what the filmmaker even said herself, some women were offended by her project.",0
"i blame birth of a nation myself - for commencing the long-running tradition of hollywood travesties of history, of which there can be few greater examples than this. apart from getting the names of custer and his 7th cavalry, crazy horse and the sioux and president grant spelt right, the geography correct and the fact that custer and his men were indeed wiped out to a man, the rest just takes hyperbole and invention to ludicrous limits. throw in some downright hackneyed scenes of the purest exposition, (try custer and his wifes learning of the phony gold rush to excuse the invasion of the sioux territory, custers testimony in front of congress pleading the rights of the red indians and to top it all, custers storming into the presidents office to beg to return to his post), honestly theres plenty more of the same, some of these scenes almost comical in their corniness... ...and yet, and yet, its still a great actioner with flynn as dashing as ever, dehavilland as beguiling as ever, the young anthony quinn getting a start as crazy horse and director walsh as barnstorming as ever in his depiction of crowd scenes and of course the tumultuous action sequences. ford taught us in liberty valance to believe the legend before the truth. here i think were closer to the legend of the legend but hey, its only a movie and a rollicking, wonderfully enjoyable classic hollywood movie at that!",1

"tale of two sisters has to be one of the creepiest films ive seen recently. in the end there is no actual supernatural element, despite what one is led to expect throughout the film. the story seems to be about two sisters, who, upon returning to their fathers home after some sort of absence (later revealed to have been a stay in a mental institution) are forced to deal with not only a seemingly schizophrenic and possibly bi-polar stepmother who lashes out at the younger of the girls when the mood strikes her and cheerfully tells them shes prepared a special dinner at another time., but some presence as yet unexplained. it is later revealed that the younger sister is dead, and exists only in the troubled minds of her older sister, who was unable to save her, and her step-mother, who was callous enough to let her die. much about the specifics of the strange family is not revealed in the film, but it definitely leaves a viewer with a creepy feeling and a nagging hint of confusion. definitely not light viewing; watch this one when you really want to think about what youve seen. its a hell of a puzzler.",1
"foolish hikers go camping in the utah mountains only to run into a murderous, disfigured gypsy. the prey is a pretty run of the mill slasher film, that mostly suffers from a lack of imagination. the victim characters are all-too-familiar idiot teens which means one doesnt really care about them, we just wonder when they will die! not to mention it has one too many cheesy moments and is padded with endless, unnecessary nature footage. however it does have a few moments of interest to slasher fans, the occasional touch of spooky atmosphere, and a decent music score by don peake. still, its business as usual for dead-camper movies.there are much better films in this vein, but over all the prey may be watchable enough for die-hard slasher fans. although one might be more rewarded to watch just before dawn (1981), wrong turn (2003), or even the final terror (1983) again.* 1/2 out of ****",0
"jp3 lacks the spielberg touch. its an all-out assault on the senses featuring in your face dinosaurs. watching this film was a bit like a roller coaster ride from hell. the script is lame; it simultaneously asks and then leaves too many questions unanswered. also, we dont really get to appreciate the humans in the film for all theyre worth. for example, william h. macy is too great a talent to have to compete with dino-thugs for our attention. and laura dern was especially sympathetic in jp1; in this film, shes barely a blip on the radar screen.the whole jp3 experience was t o o m u c h. too much noise, too many surprises, too many characters dying off, too much predictable, gratuitous violence. word to the wise: vote yourself off this island.(i rated it a 3 for special effects; i took off the other 7 points for having absolutely no originality.)",0

"what can i say about this film that wont give you any preconceived notions when you see it? very little. the plot has to do with the return from hospital of a teenage girl after she broke down. what follows after that is the movie. it is one of the creepiest most mind blowing films of the past several years. everything about the film is just slightly off center and leaves you feeling ill at ease well after the film has ended. it is not a perfect film. the film has problems in its final half hour which make an already confusing story, even more confused.(if youve read any number of other comments here on imdb and elsewhere youll know that a great deal of time has been spent trying to unlock what actually is going on) im not sure what i actually think of this film beyond the fact that it scared me and disturbed me in ways that most well known horror films ever have. if you like horror, and dont mind not having everything clearly summed up i suggest you try this since it will more than likely make your skin crawl.",1
this was one of the few norwegian movies i actually looked forward too see. it started of as a few commercials with a motley bunch at football matches. then they made a movie out of it. the leads are not pros (and you can see that) but they still do a very good job and the movie all in all blew me away.norway is known for making crappy movies (no offense)but i had a good feeling about this one. even thou im not interested in football i wanted 2 see it. the story is a lot better than expected and the laughs just keep piling up. there are loads of cameos from norwegian celebrities and players. the characters are well portrayed and you feel for them. if youre ever gonna see a norwegian movie. let it be this one!!!!,1

"this movie is good for entertainment purposes, but it is not historically reliable. if you are looking for a movie and thinking to yourself `oh i want to learn more about custers life and his last stand, do not rent `they died with their boots on. but, if you would like to watch a movie for the enjoyment of an older western film, with a little bit of romance and just for a good story, this is a fun movie to watch.the story starts out with custers (errol flynn) first day at west point. everyone loves his charming personality which allows him to get away with most everything. the movie follows his career from west point and his many battles, including his battle in the civil war. the movie ends with his last stand at little big horn. in between the battle scenes, he finds love and marriage with libby (olivia de havilland).errol flynn portrays the arrogant, but suave george armstrong custer well. olivia de havilland plays the cute, sweet libby very well, especially in the flirting scene that custer and libby first meet. their chemistry on screen made you believe in their romance. the acting in general was impressive, especially the comedic role ( although stereotypical) of callie played by hattie mcdaniel. her character will definitely make you laugh.the heroic war music brought out the excitement of the battle scenes. the beautiful costumes set the tone of the era. the script, at times, was corny, although the movie was still enjoyable to watch. the directors portrayal of custer was as a hero and history shows this is debatable. some will watch this movie and see custer as a hero. others will watch this movie and learn hate him.i give it a thumbs up for this 1942 western film.",1
"its true that they died with their boots on gives a highly fictionalized account of george armstrong custers (errol flynn) life and career, but a remarkable one, especially with regard to the battle of the little big horn. because it is not a given that a 1941 movie tries to portray both the us-american cavalryman and native american leader chief crazy horse (anthony quinn) in a favorable light. im almost tempted to say that little big man in its unqualified anti-custer stance seems unbalanced by comparison. further, one should not be mislead by the title of the picture â? this isnt just a movie about the battle of the little big horn, its a movie about that shows the unreliable west point cadet, the famed civil war hero, the indian fighter, and, last but not least, the husband.the movie begins with custers time at the west point military academy, where his recalcitrance and insubordinate behavior lead to frequent demerits. during a punitive military exercise, he meets his future wife, elizabeth bacon (olivia de havilland), who, like custer himself, is a native of monroe, michigan. custer intends to court her, but the outbreak of the civil war calls him away. custers legendary bravery is shown in a sequence of battle scenes, the greatest of which is devoted to his engagement with legendary southern cavalry general jeb stuart during the battle of gettysburg. while on leave, he travels to monroe and courts elizabeth, who promises him her hand in matrimony. immediately after the war, custer and elizabeth bacon are married.with the civil war over, custer is demoted, doesnt get a real command, and has to go through the painstakingly slow process of promotion in the small, professional american army. as he starts to drink, his wife intervenes in his behalf with former general-in-chief winfield scott. custer is given the command of the us 7th cavalry, which he trains to be an elite unit. neither custer nor crazy horse are desirous of battle, but greedy businessmen and corrupt politicians decide to build a railroad through indian lands in clear violation to earlier treaties. custer explicitly acknowledges the justice of crazy horses cause, but rides into battle to do his duty as a soldier, exposing the conspiracy of the moneyed interests in a letter he writes on the eve of battle.they died with their boots on, though short on historical accuracy, is as good as war movies and westerns in the 1940s got: both custer and crazy horse are played by major actors, neither the indians nor the southern confederacy are denigrated, and the courtship scenes with beautiful livvy de havilland are just charming. the only minus, and thats why i cant give this picture a full 10, is the undercurrent of racism in the portrayal of african american servants; elizabeths servant callie is the stereotypical, overweight, good-natured, superstitious black mammy.it is also interesting that the movie does not find fault with either custer or crazy horse, but with the greed of the railroad companies pressuring washington politicians with semi-criminal methods into breaking assurances they had given to the native americans. just a couple of years later, the insinuation that american entrepreneurs could even think of doing anything remotely questionable would probably have been taken as a hint that the film makers were communist sympathizers.needless to say that they died with their boots on omits the fact that custers overly aggressive tactics often bordered on the foolhardy, greatly overstates the importance of his engagement with stuart, and doesnt mention the lack of reconnaissance prior to the battle of the little big horn. nevertheless, custer was seen as a war hero by his contemporaries and had some spectacular exploits to point to in the battles of brandy station, gettysburg, trevilian station and others, though his feats of arms were not as decisive for the civil war as they died with their boots on suggests.in any event, they died with their boots on is a well-made war movie with western elements, three outstanding performers (flynn, quinn, and de havilland), and offers a positive view of native americans as well as a negative one on big money, which wouldnt be seen in major hollywood productions for decades to come. it would deserve a 10 if it werent for the racist minstrelization of african americans.",1
"this would probably be a good film to see....provided youve already seen every other film in existence, and thoroughly explored the bellybuttons of yourself and those around you. god, this movie was unbelievably insipid, with some of the worst (or is it nonexistent) writing ever captured on film. there is no saving grace to this film; even the animatronics are kind of lame, and its just a complete waste of time and money.run. fast. its beyond horrible.",0
"this short is one of the best of all time and is proof (just like most of charlie chaplins work) that sound and color are not requirements for quality work. in fact, this cartoon uses (and may have started) some of the gags and devices that became standard in animation in later years, like caricatures of celebrities (including the afore-mentioned chaplin. while the characters are silent, they do speak, by use of word balloons, just like in the comics. given that felix started out in newspapers as a comic strip, this device is a natural. the atmosphere and style of the short is completely harmonious with that of the comic strip while adding another dimension (literally and figuratively) and makes this short a delight to watch. well worth taking the time and effort to get. most highly recommended.",1
"even by the lowered standards of 80s slasher movies, this one stinks. the usual gaggle of oversexed teens heads for a forbidden part of forest, which burned in the 1940s and apparently left a sole angry survivor. fast forward (actually, youll want to fast-forward through much of this mess) to the present day, where a couple of campers are butchered; the teens follow in their wake, while a semi-concerned park ranger (a sleepwalking jackie coogan) and his healthier cohort (who spins a lot of time tuning his banjo) succeed partially in steering our attention from yards of run-of-the-mill nature-footage padding. finally, more killings--but nothing you havent seen a zillion times before. if you want to see the kids butchered, opt for sleepaway camp or the first friday the 13th over this",0
"this is truly, without exaggerating, one of the worst slasher movies ever made. i know, it came out in the 80s following a tendency started by friday the 13th. the prey copies the fore-mentioned movie in many aspects. the woods setting, the killer, the dumb teens, the gore, etc.but the prey is as bad as you might expect. i didnt even remember about it if it wasnt for coincidence.well, the killer is in fact human so dont expect a supernatural killer in the likes of jason. the situations rather boring and lack of tension, gore, violence, etc. it just does not works for a slasher flick.the acting is simply horrid. the score is horrible! a combination of boring instruments with cheesy 80s tunes?! i wont even mention the technical aspects of the movie because believe me, it seems that it cost only 20 dollars.please avoid this one like the plague. its one of the worst movies ive ever seen, and thats something to say. thank god it seems to have vanished from earth.",0
"this film is on my list of worst movies ever made. the story is disconnected and it is difficult to understand what is going on or the reason for the characters actions. all films need to have an inner logic, and this film just doesnt have it - the story doesnt make any sense. to see faye dunaway, christopher plummer and diana quick wasting their talents in this movie is a crime. faye dunaway is the lucky one, because she plays the victim and gets killed early in the film. on the other hand, donald sutherland must be an amazing actor because he manages to look good in spite of bad directing and bad writing; his performance is believable and he manages to stay in character in spite of everything. if dame agatha christie were alive she would die laughing! the movie is that bad!",0
"this movie was perhaps the biggest waste of 2 hours of my life. from the opening 10 minutes, i was ready to leave. the cliches there slapping you in the face, and the plot was not only predictably stupid, but full of more holes than swiss cheese. i am considering suing for that lost 2 hours, and $6.25 along with the fact that i am now stupider for watching this waste of film. the t-rexs must be flipping in their graves, so to speak.",0
"night of the hunted stars french porn star brigitte lahaie.in fact,many of the cast members in this slow-moving production were porn actors at the time of its frantic filming.this film is certainly different than rollins usual lesbian vampire flicks,but its not as memorable as for example lips of blood or fascination.lahaie plays an amnesiac hitchhiker who cant remember who she is or where she came from.most of the film takes place in a modern apartment complex,where lahaie is being held by some kind of medical group thats treating a number of people with a similar condition.anyway,she escapes from the monolithic office tower where the affected people are held.on a highway outside of town,she meets a young man,who stops and picks her up.night of the hunted offers plenty of nudity,unfortunately the pace is extremely slow.the atmosphere is horribly sad and the relationship between brigitte lahaie and another asylum inmate dominique journet is well-developed.still night of the hunted is too dull to be completely enjoyable.give it a look only if you are a fan of jean rollins works.7 out of 10 and thats being kind.",1
"i am not understanding why people are praising this movie. i didnt like it at all. i watch it with several people. none of them cared for it either. first of all. it is just plain that another low budget studio is trying to cash in on a big name story. the actual filming looks like a live tv interview. the makeup is bad. when you watch the movie along with the dvd extras. you will see there is a lot of enthusiasm from the people who participated in it. there is no talent. there are facts that do appear in the book. the facts are distorted by the invention of comedy and skits added to it. i have read several books and have watched several shows on this story. what i have always caught from all the material on this is that it was a serious horror story. i really wish someone could really do a good film on this one. it has always fascinated me. the bad acting really ruined the story. the little boys situation really hammed it up even more. when you watch this movie. the little boy and his problem is the thing you and your friends will remember and laugh about. it didnt make any sense why his brothers were laughing at what had happened to him. it was like the witch was supposed to be so threatening but it was ok to throw baby brother to her. it is a whopping tale with him and his little problem. i cant still get over the little girl saying mom said tobacco will rot your teeth. frank foxs statement and facial expression is so bad. the scene out in the yard with him getting food is pretty stupid to. the sound from parts of it seems to be from the movie psycho. also, the girl hovering over the bed and her little bladder control problem are from the exorcist. this movie is lacking from the talent of creativity. we put the movie in for a couple of minutes and knew right away it was a bummer. i also noticed that their was defects in the film quality. parts of it looked like what a person might film on a home video camera. i noticed a lot of the people in the credits had many multiple jobs. this is probably how this movie was put together. someone said i like this story. i will get all my friends and make a movie about with a video camera and a computer. doesnt matter if we dont know how to act. as long as we get it on film and say it is good. we got the family together and prepared food. then sat down and watched this failed attempt to make a movie.",0
"tokyo eyes tells of a 17 year old japanese girl who falls in like with a man being hunted by her big bro who is a cop. this lame flick is about 50% filler and 50% talk, talk, and more talk. youll get to see the less than stellar cast of three as they talk on the bus, talk and play video games, talk and get a haircut, talk and walk and walk and talk, talk on cell phones, hang out and talk, etc. as you read subtitles waiting for something to happen. the thin wisp of a story is not sufficient to support a film with low end production value, a meager cast, and no action, no romance, no sex or nudity, no heavy drama...just incessant yadayadayadaing.

i saw this movie with my girlfriend. it was a total disaster. you can really see it was cheaply made. badly scripted and with very bad acting. i have read several versions of the book by different authors and also listened to one version on audio book. we couldnt take the movie seriously because of the lacking elements it should have contained. the experience of watching this was like the blair witch visits green acres. then there were parts that were vulgar. they show this little boy using a bed pan and they actually show the contents of it. the witch throws the contents of it on the boy and the whole family laughs. i thought it was nasty and very strange. i really cant understand why someone would think that would be entertaining. it shows another scene where dr. mize arrives and betsy bell is urinating in her dress on the steps of their house in front of her mother and brothers. instead of the mother leading her off it is the brother. how sick? the little boy in the first scene of the many scenes dealing with how your body disposes of wastes begs for toilet paper and goes to the out house and makes these sickening faces of joy with sound effects. i think they should have left all of that out. the makeup on the reverend james johnston as a older man didnt really make you assume he was older. it made you think he was dipped in fish batter. the blood on joshua gardner when he falls from the ladder is even worse. the john bell death scene looks like they got out flour and tried to do something with it to make him look as a serious sick man. to me to much sickening comedy with bathroom problems and inexperienced people involved was the downfall of this picture. these people would do better if they film commercials for local tv stations for bathroom products. they chose a good subject and were unable to produce it in a correct manner. i rate this film capital f minus.,0
"i saw this film in a sneak preview, and it is delightful. the cinematography is unusually creative, the acting is good, and the story is fabulous. if this movie does not do well, it wont be because it doesnt deserve to. before this film, i didnt realize how charming shia lebouf could be. he does a marvelous, self-contained, job as the lead. theres something incredibly sweet about him, and it makes the movie even better. the other actors do a good job as well, and the film contains moments of really high suspense, more than one might expect from a movie about golf. sports movies are a dime a dozen, but this one stands out. this is one id recommend to anyone.",1

"i felt this film did have many good qualities. the cinematography was certainly different exposing the stage aspect of the set and story. the original characters as actors was certainly an achievement and i felt most played quite convincingly, of course they are playing themselves, but definitely unique. the cultural aspects may leave many disappointed as a familiarity with the chinese and oriental culture will answer a lot of questions regarding parent/child relationships and the stigma that goes with any drug use. i found the jia hongsheng story interesting. on a down note, the story is in beijing and some of the fashion and music reek of early 90s even though this was made in 2001, so its really cheesy sometimes (the beatles crap, etc). whatever, not a top ten or twenty but if its on the television, check it out.",1
"jurassic park iii *___ adventure sam nell (the dish), william macy (happy texas, fargo), tz(a leoni (family man)a better title would be: escape from the island of really mean dinosaurs. but then no one would need to see the film. in this sequel, a rag-tag group pays a visit to the island of dinosaurs to rescue the teenage victim of a hang-gliding accident.access hollywood reports jp3 began filming without a completed script. that explains why the film seems to have little or no purpose other than to demonstrate state-of-the-art special effects. sure, there are a few clever scenes and some moderately funny bits, but no meaningful plot line to tie them together. the dinosaur puppets and animation in jp3 are very good to excellent, and more numerous than ever. but the overall film experience can not hold a candle to the original jurassic park or even jp2.jp3 is a mercifully short 90 minutes -- the last 10 minutes of which is credits. even at that, i found myself frequently checking my wristwatch. the audience i saw it with left the theater in silence.a better bet: see the movie legally blonde.dave",0

"the saving grace of this film is its humour. playing up to the strengths of their star, warner brothers cast their version of general custer as a cocky, dashing, irreverent prankster with a romantic streak and an unexpected strain of idealism; it was robin hood all over again, and flynn blossomed in the role. all his best action pictures made use of his talent for mischief and comic timing, and this one was no exception.it also benefits from the return of former co-star olivia de havilland, despite an earlier agreement to break the partnership; the part of strong-minded libby custer is a better role than the sweet love-interest types she had grown tired of playing for the studio in flynns later films, and after seeing the script he had specifically requested de havilland be cast so that she could do justice to the part. in this final collaboration, she piles all her considerable acting skill into what is, at heart, basically a romping adventure movie, and the screen chemistry is rekindled -- for once, she and flynn get the chance to develop their characters beyond the initial romance into an old married couple, to equally winning effect.the flynn/de havilland pairing and the streak of comedy are what have provided this films durability, when most of flynns other westerns -- held in such affection by the contemporary american public, although allegedly not by their star -- have long since been forgotten. the action scenes are fairly cursory (despite, ironically, the death of an extra in a fall during one of the filmed charges) and the villains of the piece turn out, schoolboy-fashion, to be the same people who were horrid to our hero on his very first day at west point, and thus continue to frustrate him throughout his career. it cuts down on the cast list, but its a trifle too morally convenient.however, these are quibbles largely irrelevant to a film that never set out to be more than a rousing piece of entertainment. ably aided and abetted by a sterling group of supporting players (memorably including anthony quinn in an all-but-wordless role as the sioux leader), errol flynn gallops his way through the plot courtesy of his usual arsenal: charmingly sheepish looks, unexpected sweetness, mischievous twinkles, flash-point indignation, cheerful fellowship and sheer high-octane charisma. hes a reckless braggart, but you cant help but like him. and its hard to go away without the tune of garryowen threading its jaunty way through your ears for many days thereafter.this is one of flynns lasting hits; it also contains a surprising amount of good acting amongst the fun, and is a film worthy of being remembered.",1
"in watching this off and on for a few seasons, two things come to mind: one - wondering what kind of girl wants to be a model and two - run to the nearest ice cream store and have a low fat sundae.i tried to be a fan because i liked the idea of this reality show competition. no other famous model thought of this, and it is very admirable for tyra banks to do so. but as the series goes on and on ive come to the conclusion that this is a sorry lot of folks trying to make a mountain out of a molehill. women shouldnt watch this, teens should stay clear of it unless theyre doing book reports on the subject.many women try out for slots to compete for americas next top model. they live together, cat fight together, cry together, get put through pointless modeling shoots with pointless modeling people and fashionatas and get eliminated and almost all of them claim, you will see me again. heck, im trying to see what happened to the ones that did win, actually.this is the dream of some girls, and good for them. in watching this i hope the other girls that see this and run like hades the other way - like to college.i just happened to watch more of this recent season because of the ploy of full figured models joining the group. that even made me think more of this as a sorry lot of folks. the full figured models were no more than average sized ladies competing with what i think is the thinnest group of models they ever chose - so of course that would make them look even fatter - a ploy fashionatas use all the time. bad, bad, tyra and crew.but to be fair, americas next top model is not about full figured models, its about projecting an imagined image a beauty that can be mass marketed and sold as the ultimate in beauty - and this show is just looking for the next fresh piece of meat to add to the mix. hence the name of the show. hence the sorry lot of judges, photographers, associations. hence tyra and her consistent this was me plugs every camera angle you can get. but then again, that is the one thing i like about this show - the ex-model giving others who wouldnt have the chance -- a chance to enter the doors. but after that...everything else is status quo for that industry which is why there are no surprises or week to week interest in the program.",0

"seeing this film for the first time twenty years after its release i dont quite get it. why has this been such a huge hit in 1986? its amateurishness drips from every scene. the jokes are lame and predictable. the sex scenes are exploitative and over the top (that is not to say that miss rudnik does not have nice boobs!). the singing is schrecklich. the only genuinely funny scene is the big shoot out when the gangsters die break dancing, a trait that dates the movie firmly to the mid-eighties. its really quite puzzling to me how incapable i am to grasp what evoked the enthusiasm of the cheering audiences in 1986 (and apparently still today, reading my fellow imdbers comments).",0

"as a recreational golfer with some knowledge of the sports history, i was pleased with disneys sensitivity to the issues of class in golf in the early twentieth century. the movie depicted well the psychological battles that harry vardon fought within himself, from his childhood trauma of being evicted to his own inability to break that glass ceiling that prevents him from being accepted as an equal in english golf society. likewise, the young ouimet goes through his own class struggles, being a mere caddie in the eyes of the upper crust americans who scoff at his attempts to rise above his standing. what i loved best, however, is how this theme of class is manifested in the characters of ouimets parents. his father is a working-class drone who sees the value of hard work but is intimidated by the upper class; his mother, however, recognizes her sons talent and desire and encourages him to pursue his dream of competing against those who think he is inferior.finally, the golf scenes are well photographed. although the course used in the movie was not the actual site of the historical tournament, the little liberties taken by disney do not detract from the beauty of the film. theres one little disney moment at the pool table; otherwise, the viewer does not really think disney. the ending, as in miracle, is not some disney creation, but one that only human history could have written.",1

"despite the title and unlike some other stories about love and war, this film isnt too sticky and pink, because love is as a rose: with thorns, that is. the four leading actors set their characters realistic and with a good sense and balance between the tragic and the down-to-earth. the music and lyrics of the cabaret/chanson-esquire songs (sung b keira knightley herself) drag the viewer deeper and deeper in the film, from one place to another, between the brutal war and amongst the peaceful love. some people may find it too much a biopic, but it ã­s mostly a romantic story, even though it consequently follows the life of dylan thomas and the triangular relationship which is steeped by joy and jealousy. london gets visualized from another angle for once, the bohemian life of dylan during the bombings of the germans is set in a floating atmosphere of small bedrooms, pubs and bars. the independent women, the soldier and the charismatic poet are constantly swept in both feelings of love and anger. maybe the end is too twisted and hangs somewhat loosely to the rest of the film, but all in all this is a great romantic story.",1
"1980 was certainly a year for bad backwoods slasher movies. friday the 13th and the burning may have been the best ones but there were like always a couple of stinkers not far behind like dont go into the woods alone and this one. but in all fairness the prey is nowhere near as bad as dont go into the woods but its still not great either. one thing is that its just boring and acting isnt very good but much better than dgitw and this movie actually has some attractive looking females to look at, all three of the female leads were stunning. one thing what is up with all that pointless wildlife footage it just seemed pointless and it looked as the director used that to just used that to fill up some time space.so, what was there to like about this movie? well, there were a few laugh out loud cheese moments- i couldnt contain a fit of giggles when the final girl did a bizarre type of backwards moon-walk to get away from the kille and there were a few good kill scenes- my favourites being the girl suffocated to death with the sleeping bag; and the phoney looking.all in all the prey is dumb, boring and the killer i didnt find scary at all, this movie could have been a whole lot better.",0
"although this film changes reality to make it more heroic and entertaining, sometimes fantasy is more enjoyable than real life, and also nothing could be more real than errol flynn playing custer. this remains the best film made about custer. the music of max steiner is magnificent and also all through the film the irish song gerry owen, which was a favourite of custer is played. the film should have more villains, because they try to concentrate all the bad guys in arthur kennedy. the relationship between flynn and de havilland flows like in no other off their films together, and director raoul walsh with his experience in outside scenes with a lot of actors is at his best.",1
"the adventures of hercules has to be one of the lamest excuses for a movie ive yet run across. you would have to look far and wide to find anything that approaches the level of ineptness on display in this movie. acting â? bad. editing â? bad. direction â? bad. special effects â? bad and laughable. plot â? bad. lighting â? bad. cinematography â? bad. costume design â? bad and silly. everything else â? bad. watching the adventures of hercules is about as enjoyable as a root canal. even for a fan of bad movies, its a real endurance test. this is one for either masochists or lou ferrigno completists (if any exist).eight things i learned from watching the adventures of hercules: 1. if you dont have the budget for real special effects, rotoscope a scene from the previous movie. it will look great - trust me.2. when on a quest to recover zeus thunderbolts, take time for frequent stops to oil-up you body. it worked for ferrigno and his two amazon companions.3. any sword fight, use of magic, and just about all other day to day activities in ancient greece created a sound very similar to a game of pac man or asteroids.4. some of the ancient greek gods dressed like extras from star wars.5. if you need to pad your crappy movies runtime, extend the title sequence by adding star trek style credits and throw in some overly grandiose music. it also helps if youve got a previous movie to pull scenes from.6. fight scenes move along much smoother if the bad guys attack hercules one at a time.7. william berger did anything for money.8. i didnt think it was possible, but the adventures of hercules makes the first film, hercules (1983), look like an academy award winner.",0
"i was disappointed with the third film in the death wish series and wouldnt recommend this unless you are really into bronson. he is his usual self in this one, maybe a bit lighter hearted than in the others; the rest of the cast is good if your watching a movie of the week on t.v. - the whole film has the production value of a bad episode of the a-team and i like the escapism fun of a show like the a-team but not on the big screen, even if it is an action movie that doesnt claim to be anything to sophisticated. the film takes a while to get going and then when it finally does, it gets out of control to the point of ridiculousness. the plot is something out of an episode of highway to heaven and bronson seems like a fish out of water with the majority senior citizen cast and the gun play is so out of control you dont even get any satisfaction from bronsons revenge against the bad guys. skip this and go on to the 4th installment which i highly recommend.",0
"this is one of those strange, self-important, self-indulgent movies which tries too hard to be profound. it isnt. instead, it spouts cliches that try to pass for profundity. typical is the scene where peter (kelsey grammer) explains to protagonist and best friend adam (dwier brown) how man starts life breast feeding, then moves on to sucking the breast of his girlfriend, and finally his wife, thus concluding ultimately that life sucks. so deep. we are treated to a variety of characters who offer their perspective of life, the universe, etc. during adams travels through the mojave desert on foot. (he abruptly leaves l.a. the day of his wedding and his family, friends, and fiance assume hes dead when his car was found in a military test range smashed by a rocket.) some characters are more entertaining than others. the best by far is an escapee from a mental hospital who only speaks through the voices of others. the actor, james kevin ward, does some great impressions, including nicholson, popeye, and several characters from the original star trek. but once the interesting characters leave the screen, were stuck with adam again and his pursuit of the profound. its a long trip, which drags in many places. in fact, its the longest hour and a half movie ive ever seen. and the finale hardly makes it seem worth while, at all.i discovered this movie playing on hbo one day by waking up too early and clicking on the tv. thatll learn me. next time ill try harder to sleep in.",0
"oh yeah, this one is definitely a strong contender to win the questionable award of worst 80s slasher ever made. the prey has got everything you usually want to avoid in a horror flick: a routine, derivative plot that youve seen a thousand times before (and better), insufferable characters and terrible performances, a complete lack of gore and suspense, fuzzy photography and unoriginal locations and â? most irritating of all â? the largest amount of pointless padding footage youve ever encountered in your life (and thats not an exaggeration but a guarantee!). apart from the seemingly endless amount of national geographic stock footage, which ill expand upon later, this film is shameless enough to include a complete banjo interlude (!) and two occasions where characters tell dillydally jokes that arent even remotely funny! the set-up is as rudimentary as it gets, with the intro showing images of a devastating forest fire with ott voice-over human screams. fast forward nearly forty years later, when an elderly couple out camping in that same area get axe-whacked by something that breathes heavily off-screen. this ought to be enough information for you to derive that someone survived the fire all these years ago and remained prowling around ever since. enter three intolerable twenty something couples heading up to the danger zone with exclusively sex on their minds, unaware of course they are sitting ducks for the stalking and panting killer. the prey is an irredeemable boring film. apparently it was shot in 1978 already, but nobody wanted to distribute it up until 1984 and it isnt too hard to see why. in case you would filter out all the content that is actually relevant, this would only be a short movie with a running time of 30 minutes; possibly even less. theres an unimaginably large of nature and wildlife footage, sometimes of animals that i think dont even live in that type of area, and they seem to go on forever. the only thing missing, in fact, is the typical national geographic narration providing educational information regarding the animals habits. animals in their own natural biotope are undeniably nice to look at, but not in a supposedly vile and cheesy 80s slasher movie, for crying out loud. the last fifteen minutes are finally somewhat worthwhile, with some potent killing sequences and fine make-up effects on the monster (who turns out to be lurch from the addams family movies), but still silliness overrules â? the scene with the vultures is too stupid â? and the final shot is just laugh-out-loud retarded. as mentioned above, the prey easily makes my own personal list of worst 80s slashers, alongside appointment with fear, berserker, deadly games, dont go in the woods, hollow gate, the stay awake and curfew.",0
"heres a decidedly average italian post apocalyptic take on the hunting/killing humans for sport theme ala the most dangerous game, turkey shoot, gymkata and the running man.certainly the film reviewed here is nowhere near as much fun as the other listed entries and is furthermore dragged down by poor voice over work, generally bland action sequences, a number of entirely tasteless scenes such as a prolonged rape sequence and some truly stupid and illogical points throughout.take for example towards the end of the film, when our hero manages to infiltrate the compound of the villains. he initially kills a sentry and leaves him in his jeep. upon discovery of the said corpse, the villains response? (bearing in mind that our hero has come to brutally murder them all) â? they resolve to wait until the next morning to look for the culprit (!!!!!!!!!!)however, i suppose to be fair the film remains nonetheless about watchable if you can suspend your disbelief during such stupid scenes and does benefit immensely by the presence of the always excellent woody strode (even if his screen time is very limited)not a classic by any stretch of the imagination but still just about worthy of a watch for italian b-movie enthusiasts.",0
"if you like madonna or not, this movie is hilarious!! i am a madonna fan and did see this in the theater at the time of its release. however, over time it has not lost its silliness and pure fun. sure there are some bad lines & cheesy acting but the whole film is just a screwball comedy with madonna actually carrying the whole film with great bombast. she is cute,funny, and is the only comedic role of her movie career. madonna usually just plays herself in roles but watching her as nikki finn in this film, she really seems like somebody else for once. of course the film is directed by james foley (who filmed the dramatic and haunting at close range with sean penn & christopher walken) and co-stars griffin dunn (after hours) who is also brilliantly cast and has fun with the material. the story is nothing genius and dont expect some climatic ending but if you are ever in the mood to watch a fun, clean, 80s romp or if you are a madonna fan than this is a must see. the soundtrack is also very notable and contains 4 madonna songs: the #1 hit whos that girl, the #2 hit causing a commotion and the beautiful and one of her best ever ballads the look of love(top 10 hit in the uk) and cant stop a left over pop ditty from the true blue sessions the year before. it is only on vhs but will soon be available on dvd.",1
"from the fertile imagination which brought you the irresistible hercules (1983), comes its even more preposterous (read goofier) sequel: right off the bat, we get another unwieldy beginning of time prologue which even contrives to completely contradict these same events as set up in the first film!; a condensed montage of highlights from same is soon followed by a superman-like scrolling credits sequence. narrative-wise, here we have four rebellious gods who steal zeus seven all-important (but poorly animated) thunderbolts â? a crime which, for one thing, sets the moon careening on a collision course with planet earth! faster than you can say nepotism, zeus (once again played as a white-haired bearded man by the relatively young claudio cassinelli) sends his champion â? who has now rightfully taken his place among the elite thanks to, one presumes, the almighty tasks performed in the first film â? to find his blooming thunderbolts and avert the calamities in store.no sooner has hercules (lou ferrigno â? as if you didnt know) touched the earthly surface that he comes in contact with two attractive damsels (milly carlucci and sonia viviani) in need of his getting them out of distress!; the former (who would go on to become an italian tv personality) seemingly has the ability to talk with the little people(!) â? which look uncannily like the tiny sisters from godzilla vs. mothra (1964)!! just so they can swindle as much unutilzed footage from the first film as is humanly possible, the divine quartet of villains resurrect good ol king minos (william berger again) from his skeletal slumber and pit him once more against his eternal enemy. typically, hercules is made to encounter a number of potentially deadly foes including a gorgon â? an awfully underproduced sequence which ought to have led to a surefire plagiarism suit had the film-makers behind the much superior clash of the titans (1981) bothered to watch this flick (complete with the same reflection in a shield come-uppance and preceded by the muscleman letting the audience in on his tactics before executing them as if to show us how clever he is)!! and just to make it crystal clear that he wears his influences on his sleeve, cozzi has hercules and minos turn into a cosmic version of king kong vs. godzilla for one of their battles and later still, king kong gets to grips with a large snake, an encounter lifted straight out of the classic 1933 original. i swear it: this is the whole truth and nothing but the truth! as had been the case with the first film, the cast is full of old reliables like the afore-mentioned berger, cassinelli and venantino venantini (as a sorcerer with a truly bad hair day) and up-and-coming starlets â? not just carlucci but also maria rosaria omaggio (as a younger hera!), serena grandi, pamela prati and, once again, eva robbins (whose costume here easily outcamps her appearance in the first film); for what its worth, pino donaggios score for this one is recycled from musical cues featured in his soundtrack for the previous film. if you have stuck with this review so far, you must have realized by now that this is one of those movies that is so unbelievably bad that a reviewer is forced to choose which course to take: either dismiss it in one unflattering sentence or spend an undeserving amount of time dissecting its flaws. im sure ive left out some of its ineptitudes but i wouldnt forgive myself if i failed to mention the single greatest laugh-out loud instance in the whole movie which almost made me fall off my chair (yes, it even surpassed the afore-mentioned animated titanic duel for me), namely the dã©cor of the rebellious gods lair which is in the shape of a giant marbleâ?kettle!!at this stage, one might well wonder why i gave this film (and its predecessor) a rating instead of a (not entirely unjustified) bomb; in the past, ive had various protracted online discussions on whether ones star rating of any particular film should reflect the overall artistic quality or its sheer entertainment valueâ? but these are two instances where i deemed it necessary to be consciously influenced by the latter in settling on my final rating. i dont know: maybe its because im in a sword-and-sandal state-of-mind at the moment (with some 10 more respectable examples scheduled for the coming days!) but, after all, uncharacteristically for me, i decided to add these two films to my dvd collection simply based on the fun i had with them in this recent revisit â? and that alone must count for something, no?",0
"i love ghost stories and i will sit through a movie til its end, even if im not really enjoying it. i rarely feel like i wasted my time... but, this adaptation of the bell witch story was horrible! it wasnt scary in the least bit. what is with the comic relief moments? the dialog was tedious. acting inconsistent the movie was way too long and some scenes were unnecessarily drawn out in my open. (like the birthday party)the only good think i can think about mentioning is the costumes and props were well done.i am curious about other adaptation, but until then, i will stick to reading about the story.",0
"not even the beatles could write songs everyone liked, and although walter hill is no mop-top hes second to none when it comes to thought provoking action movies. the nineties came and social platforms were changing in music and film, the emergence of the rapper turned movie star was in full swing, the acting took a back seat to each mans overpowering regional accent and transparent acting. this was one of the many ice-t movies i saw as a kid and loved, only to watch them later and cringe. bill paxton and william sadler are firemen with basic lives until a burning building tenant about to go up in flames hands over a map with gold implications. i hand it to walter for quickly and neatly setting up the main characters and location. but i fault everyone involved for turning out lame-o performances. ice-t and cube must have been red hot at this time, and while ive enjoyed both their careers as rappers, in my opinion they fell flat in this movie. its about ninety minutes of one guy ridiculously turning his back on the other guy to the point you find yourself locked in multiple states of disbelief. now this is a movie, its not a documentary so i wont waste my time recounting all the stupid plot twists in this movie, but there were many, and they led nowhere. i got the feeling watching this that everyone on set was sord of confused and just playing things off the cuff. there are two things i still enjoy about it, one involves a scene with a needle and the other is sadlers huge 45 pistol. bottom line this movie is like dominos pizza. yeah ill eat it if im hungry and i dont feel like cooking, but im well aware it tastes like crap. 3 stars, meh.",0
"i havent been a fan of madonna for quite sometime now, however, i thought i would comment on this film.this film mistaken. one of them, as well as madonna, was panned by the critics. they were highly mistaken and many potential viewers were turned off by the bad reviews.first, madonna does an excellent job in this movie which was one of her first. she plays a ditsy blonde in the film, she is far from a ditsy blonde in real life. most critics were somewhat prejudiced by her singing fame and didnt give her a fair shake. when you view this film i hope that you understand that the accent and the goofiness is just acting. she was absolutely hysterical as was the film.griffen dunne is another person who was not given a fair review in the film. if you take a look at his filmography, you will see he is quite an accomplished actor.as far as the movie itself, this is something similar to pretty woman, but came 3 years before the roberts, gere success. its a goof-ball comedy with lots of site gags, slapstick and one liners. some of the comedy is deadpan and takes a comedy aficionado to really appreciate the more subtle humor.i know this doesnt tell you much about the movie, however, i hope this helps dispel any belief that this is a poor movie. it is absolutely worth renting for an enjoyable night of great fun.peace.gary",1

"filmed in arizona by a mostly-foreign crew, nightkill is one of the clumsiest crime dramas i have ever seen. robert mitchum (in a cowboy hat) trails recently-widowed jaclyn smith around, hoping to figure out if she had a hand in her husbands death. jaclyns wardrobe is of the dale evans variety and her dog is named cowboy...seems as if somebody sure bought into the american myth that all westerners talk and dress like descendants of john wayne! screenplay by joan andre and john case may have worked better if approached as parody; this mystery thriller just plays tame, with director ted post asleep at the controls. dont be drawn in by the video box art of jaclyn screaming while taking a shower. she does indeed take a shower in this film, but it is not revealing (nor does it further the murky plot one iota). no stars from ****",0
"im a huge fan of both emily watson (breaking the waves) and tom wilkinson (normal) and was amused to see them upstaged by rupert everett (dellamorte dellamore) in this shockingly rather minor movie that had all the ingredients to be so much more. the too brief scenes in which he portrays a languid, infinitely entitled, worthless son of a rich lord are spot-on and entertaining. but for a love triangle there was remarkably little chemistry to speak of between anyone. the music was annoyingly movie-of-the-week quality, and the voice-over jarring and totally unnecessary. clearly the work of a first-time director with a small budget who either lacked or didnt sufficiently heed good advice. too bad.i can appreciate how the people you kind of hate at the beginning are the ones you kind of like at the end, and vice-versa, so there is some sort of character arc, at least in terms of perception. for example, watsons character, while refreshingly honest to her husband about her feelings for another man, began to grate on me near the end, particularly when she announced to her husband that she simply had absolutely no control over her actions, and later when she simply declared that she would be moving back into their marital flat, with no asking of permission, no apologies offered. and i went from disliking wilkinsons control freak / moral relativist character to sort of understanding him and not really wanting him to change (unlike his wife).this movie awkwardly morphed from a whodunit to a love story or steel magnolias illness drama without sufficiently informing me of the fact, so i was left distractedly guessing what the next plot twist might be long after they had all been revealed (was it the lord driving the car? the lords dog?). the scene where the lord visits wilkinson and relates how brave watson is, the bestest nurse any dying boyfriend could ever ask for, florence nightingale incarnate, etc. was ok until he started over-the-top sobbing like a baby. good god! if you ask me shes just another flitty rich person with way too much time on her hands, and so she drives her hard working, well providing spouse crazy with unnecessary drama. her screwing around was just another way to occupy her empty life; the dying guy thing was an added bonus for her as it somehow made her previous actions completely above reproach.look, everyone would have been better off if wilkinson had just left her for his secretary, who seemed to appreciate him for who he was. instead he acted like an abused dog, his open craving for his wifes affection increasing with every kick she gives him. im not anti pc or anything, it just didnt ring true, even after taking into account all of the harsh realities of middle age we all tend to face. the ending for me was (and not the directors intention i am certain) depressing. the movie spent the last 80 minutes convincing me that these two people just dont belong together, so i found no joy in the promise of their relationship continuing. im not above wanting my emotions manipulated by a story, it just has to be somewhat plausible and not hackneyed. is that asking too much?my score: 4/10",0
"the film is excellent. one of the most noteworthy things about it is that flynns performance is superb. this is worth stressing, as he was often derided as an actor by bette davis et al.i remember the scene where flynn gets arthur kennedy drunk in order to take him to his doom at the battle of the little big horn. the cold, calculating look on flynns face as he does so is extraordinary - much better than the much vaunted spencer tracy or many other stars could have done.the other thing to note is the excellent performance by george p. huntley jr as lt queens own butler. it is baffling why he stopped making films shortly afterwards - one would have thought that he would have been set up for years after as a character actor.",1
"so, madonna isnt meryl streep. still, this is one of her first films and a comedy at that. give her a break! sure, the movie is mediocre at best and pales in comparison to its earlier counterpart w/ katherine hepburn, bringing up baby. for what it is, though(a piece of fluff), its quite a bit of fun to watch. ive yet to hear anyone that slams madonnas acting skills back it up w/ evidence or even adjectives other than awful, bad, or other such vague descriptive words. if you wanna see bad acting or justify the argument that singers should stick to singing, how about whitney houston?? shes had the most undeserved commercial success of any actress in history and couldnt act her way out of a hatbox. the american public obviously cannot discern the difference between a credible performance in a movie and star power. i think madonna has always been at least credible in her movies. get real people. madonna-bashing is so 90s.",1
"this is a wonderful film as a film - it gets an 8 out of 10. as a filmed piece of accurate history...one wishes to be more loving, but it is a 5 out of 10. and i think i am actually being very charitable.what was he like - that man of horse and saber who was the youngest boy general in the union army of the american civil war, and ended dying with all his command in the greatest military victory of the north american indian tribes? opinionated, militant, bumptious, bloody-handed, ambitious, clever, too-clever, indian-foe, indian-friend(?), and national hero. his death in 1876 was treated as a national tragedy and pushed him into a position of fame equal to washington, lincoln, jackson, and grant/lee, and sherman/jackson. it is only with a growing awareness of the mistakes made in his career - the overly ambitious hot-spur, that his reputation declined. yet to this day, george armstrong custer remains the best recalled figure in our historys military annals to lose his last battle (i cant really think of a similar one - maybe general jonathan mayhew wainwright, forced to stay with his men on the bataan death march - but wainwright survived the march and the second world war). custer has appeared in more films than far better generals, due to the western adventures and little big horn. pity that the details of the real career were never handled so lovingly as raoul walsh and errol flynn handled them in this film. but even in 1941 the legend was still potent. olivia de haviland portrayed libby custer, who was recently pointed out in another film review on this thread survived george until 1933, so her effective handling of the story was still in place eight years later. custer was seen as our wayward but brave knight errant, and with the shadow of world war ii looming closer we had to keep the myth and bury the truth. john ford would have fully understood this and approved it.so we get the view that he was a hot-spur, but he was patriotic. although almost pushed out of west point by demerits (which was true), custer was in the class of 1861, and it would have been really stupid to be picky about such a fighter that year. you see, most of the so-called military talent from west point (from robert e. lee down) was southern, and joined the confederacy. the union needed every northern point man they could find.custers civil war career should be given closer study - he was attached to the staff of general - in - chief george b. mcclellan, and distinguished himself in the peninsula campaign and other eastern front warfare. but he was a cavalryman - and he would rise under the watchful eyes of grant and shermans buddy phil sheridan in the latter parts of the war. in particular he served with dash and distinction at the battle of cedar creek, which ended the threat of the confederacy in the shenandoah valley. it also hit custer hard on a personal level (his close west point friend, stephen ramseur, joined the confederacy and rose to a position like custer - mortally wounded, custer sat with ramseur all through the latters last night alive).following the war things fell apart. he wanted to make his brevet - major generalship permanent (it wasnt, as it was a battlefield promotion). they only had a lt. colonelship to give him in the shrunken army along the frontier. he tried to play politics, making the error of supporting president andrew johnson on a political trip in 1866, and finding most northerners hated johnson as an inept idiot. he supposedly admired the indians (he certainly was eloquent in writing of them and the west), but he caused a genuine military massacre in 1868 of indian women and children that ended with a court martial. later, during the 1870s he would support indian claims against a ring of politicians (that went up to the secretary of war, william belknap) who bought and sold indian trading posts for profit. it ruined belknap, and left a black eye on the grant administration. it put him into the doghouse with grant and sherman (who was belknaps former commander), and sheridan barely saved his career. then he was sent on the final big horn campaign. and immortality arrived.that career is worth a real film, but would it be too critical? should we hold a man of the 1850s - 1876 to the standards of 2007? would we like that done to us in a hundred years? certainly it could happen, but im not sure wed like it.custer (1941 style) fit flynn like a glove, with his giving the closest to a dance performance in any of his major films. his final movie with olivia de haviland is underlined with a melancholy due to the fate of the heros character. in support actors like sidney greenstreet, stanley ridges, arthur kennedy and anthony quinn did very nicely as friends, foes, or even treacherous sneaks (kennedy). as an entertaining piece of myth making it remains high - but as a study of a complex military hero it is not what it should be.",1
"all in all, an excellent movie from that time and source (coming from warner brothers as it was peaking in craftsmanship and style just before wwii), provided you dont take it at all seriously. the movie really makes no claim to being historically accurate, and is certainly no more or less accurate or believable than say, jfk. (this one may actually be more honest about it, though, as it essentially admits along the way that its not to be taken as particularly fact-based, but more of a stylishly semi-heroic portrayal.) its worth noting that audiences of the time were no more naive about the story than we are today; the ny times review conceded that audiences would dismiss factual inaccuracies sprinkled throughout the film, described the biographical account of custers life as fanciful, and pointed out that the presentation of custers motivations regarding the final events were at odds with various historical accounts. they could have really gone overboard in building up custer, one supposes, but they succeed admirably in depicting him as not necessarily the sharpest or most diligent guy around, but appropriately determined, principled and inspirational.flynn and dehavilland, doing their 8th movie together in 7 years (and their last), are so comfortable together, and play off each other so easily at this point, that its not too difficult to overlook how thinly their courtship is written here. with a first-time pairing, it would be hard to imagine what could really draw elizabeth to custer, but these two make it work. the movie is also missing their director from their previous seven films together (the greatly underrated michael curtiz), but given that he had worked with them on the previous years similar-themed santa fe trail, its understandable if he chose to opt out of this one. (they all started together with captain blood and the charge of the light brigade - both terrific - so we cant really blame them if they started having a tough time keeping it all fresh.)raoul walsh, the director here, is certainly more comfortable with the action sequences - which are outstanding - and everything else outdoors. the interior scenes are a little more uneven, but the studio craftsmen succeed in compensating for that very well, as does warner bros outstanding cast of usual suspects and new faces (greenstreet, gene lockhart, anthony quinn, arthur kennedy, etc). i would have liked it better if kennedys character had been a bit less standard (i generally like his work), but here he seems to be hitting roughly the same notes in every scene; the part could have been better written - and i suppose they might have been unsure of what he could handle, as hed only been in films for one year (walsh probably took him for this after doing high sierra together).various highlights include the depiction (probably imagined) of the genesis of garryowen as the cavalry theme. the last half hour is particularly outstanding, especially with the parting of the leads echoing the end of their screen partnership, followed by the final battle scenes. a thoroughly rousing adventure.8 of 10",1

"uhhh ... so, did they even have writers for this? maybe im picky, but i like a little dialog with my movies. and, as far as slasher films go, just a sliver of character development will suffice.unfortunately, the prey provides neitherâ?and if you think im being hyperbolic, youll just have to see it for yourself. scene after scene, we just get actors standing around, looking forlorn and awkward, abandoned by any sense of a script. outside of calling out each others names when they get separated in the woods (natch), the only instances where these people say something substantive is when one character explains the constellation orion (clearly plagiarized from funk & wagnalls; scintillating slasher fare, no?) and another rehashes an old campfire tale that doesnt even have anything to do with the plot (wait, what is the plot?) at other times, the prey actually has the gall to film its characters with the boom mic just far away enough so that we cant exactly hear what theyre saying. so we get entire scenes wherein the actors are murmuring! deliberately! seriously, ive seen more dialog in a silent film. its as if the filmmakers sat down at a bar somewhere in rancho cucamonga in the heyday of the 80s slasher craze and one looked at the other and said, hey, i gotta really sweet idea for a gory decapitation gag. lets somehow pad an entire feature around it. and ... well, they did. to be fair, the prey probably had some sort of writer on board. i mean, somebody had to jot down the scene sequence and label the dailies. however, i am fully convinced that this film did not have an editor of any kind whatsoever. there are glaring pauses, boring tableaux, and zero sense of pacing throughout. the filmmakers dont have anything else in the script to film, so they fill out the running time with exhaustive taxonomies of the flora and fauna that inhabit the forest in which our wild and crazy teens are getting sliced and diced. these critters are all filmed in straightforward, noontime daylight in a completely reserved fashion and with no attempt at atmospheric photography. if it feels like a science film, thats because it is. im pretty sure this is all nature show stock footageâ?all thats missing is a stuffy narration from some national geographic alderman.more exciting footage that was graciously spared from the cutting room floor: a scene in which two men discuss cucumber and cream cheese sandwiches, and another scene wherein a supporting character strums away on a banjo for what feels like an entire minute-and-a- half! a minute-and-a-half! thats a lot of banjoing to commit to celluloid to begin with, let alone insert into the final cut of the film! way to go, guys! brevity and concision are the real victims of this slaughterfest.admittedly, the film picks up quite a bit of steam (comparatively) in the last 25 minutes, into which much of the carnage is condensed and where a rip-off of bã©la bartã³ks music for strings, percussion and celesta cuts in. vaudeville great jackie coogan makes a fun appearance as a tubby, bumbly park ranger (this was his last role, if you can believe it). and there are some nice gory moments, including a splattery neck tearing and the aforementioned decapitation. the make-up used for the killer (carel struycken, aka lurch from the addams family movies) is also quite effective, and makes him look like a strange hybrid of young jason voorhees and freddy krueger. plus, if you love wacky, straight-outta-left-field endings, you need to check out how they wrap this puppy up. youll do a spit take, i promise.usually, i love films that are on this level of ineptitude, but the first three-quarters of the prey are just so interminably boring that they pretty much spoil the rest. overall, this is a largely pallid and tedious affair, and, while it aint all bad, it should really only be seen by debilitated slasher completists. why do we do this to ourselves, anyway?",0
"this film is absolutely appalling and awful. its not low budget, its a no budget film that makes ed woods movies look like art. the acting is abysmal but sets and props are worse then anything i have ever seen. an ordinary subway train is used to transport people to the evil zone of killer mutants, woddy strode has one bullet and the fight scenes are shot in a disused gravel pit. there is sadism as you would expect from an 80s italian video nasty. no talent was used to make this film. and the female love interest has a huge bhind- italian taste maybe. even for 80s italian standards this film is pretty damn awful but i guess it came out at a time when there werent so many films available on video or viewers werent really discerning. this piece of crap has no entertainment value whatsoever and its not even funny, just boring and extremely cheap. its actually and insult to the most stupid audience. i just wonder how on earth an actor like woody strode ended up ia a turkey like this?",0
"although they died with their boots on is not entirely historically accurate it is a very entertaining western. not only is flynn the perfect custer, the character actors are superb. besides the action portion of the movie flynn and dehavillands love scenes are very touching and believable.(flynn and dehavilland were very fond of each other in real life). flynn was always so tormented for being not taken seriously if only he knew that there were very few actors who could play the characters he played and play them well!",1
"the historical inaccuracies of this film have been well documented. it was never intended to be serious history but an entertaining saga and there it succeeds. errol flynn was never better as this role was tailored for him. olivia dehavilland was never more beautiful. arthur kennedy never more villainous. anthony quinn never more noble than as crazy horse. it had much humor and pathos and held your interest throughout. the one historical aspect i found most glaringly inaccurate was the final last stand which occurred on the banks of the little big horn. the film version was filmed in a desert with no river in sight. however, i still consider it marvelous entertainment typical of hollywoods golden age.",1

"i`ve seen this movie twice, both times on cinemax. the first time in it`s unrated version which is soft-core porn at it`s best and the second time in a trimmed down (cut all the sex and most of the nudity out) version which was entertaining in a typical beach movie sort of way. the unrated version has a tremendous sex scene with nikki fritz, a dude and a bottle of oil which is out of this world (no pun intended). unfortunately, in the trimmed version that scene is almost completely chopped out, as are all the other sex scenes. rated or unrated it is still fun to watch all the siblings of bigger stars (stallone, sheen, travolta, etc;) trying to act. we also get appearances by b-queen linnea quigley and burt ward (robin from the old batman series).",1
"maybe im reading into this too much, but i wonder how much of a hand hongsheng had in developing the film. i mean, when a story is told casting the main character as himself, i would think he would be a heavy hand in writing, documenting, etc. and that would make it a little biased.but...his family and friends also may have had a hand in getting the actual details about hongshengs life. i think the best view would have been told from hongshengs family and friends perspectives. they saw his transformation and werent so messed up on drugs that they remember everything.as for hongsheng being full of himself, the consistencies of the jesus christ pose make him appear as a martyr who sacrificed his life (metaphorically, of course, hes obviously still alive as he was cast as himself) for his familys happiness. huh?the viewer sees him at his lowest points while still maintaining a superiority complex. he lies on the grass coming down from (during?) a high by himself and with his father, he contemplates life and has visions of dragons at his window, he celebrates his freedom on a bicycle all while outstretching his arms, his head cocked to the side.its fabulous that hes off of drugs now, but hes no hero. he went from a high point in his career in acting to his most vulnerable point while on drugs to come back somewhere in the middle.this same device is used in ted demmes blow where the audience empathizes with the main character who is shown as a flawed hero.however, quitting (zuotian) is a film that is recommended, mostly for its haunting soundtrack, superb acting, and landscapes. but, the best part is the feeling that one gets when what we presume to be the house of jia hongsheng is actually a stage setting for a play. it makes the viewer feel as if hongshengs life was merely a play told in many difficult parts.",1
"bell witch haunting (aka the haunt) is an american horror movie supposedly based on real events that took place during the period 1817 to 1821.this is not to be confused with bell witch: the movie, a movie starring betsy palmer based on the same events. however, i can say that i wish i had seen this other movie instead of the one i saw! i enjoyed betsy palmers chilling performance in friday the 13th. as such, i believe that even on a bad day, shed pull off a better performance than anyone involved in the travesty known as the haunt.with regard to my heading, this movie is not painful to watch because the content is disturbing. it is painful to watch because it is just downright boring.reading the positive reviews for this movie, i could only identify three possibilities. the first possibility - these authors were involved in the production in some way. the second possibility - the authors whilst not directly involved were paid to write positive reviews after production was completed. the final possibility - none of these authors has seen a sufficient number of horror movies and therefore is inexperienced with the concepts that successful attempts utilise.the setting for the plot is robertson county, tennessee. james johnston receives a visit from two journalists eager to hear the story of the bell witch. the story is told as a series of flashbacks. a series of supernatural events begin happening at the home of john bell and his family. it soon transpires that a vengeful spirit is behind it all.on the surface the plot appears to be a standard poltergeist affair, albeit one based on real events.where execution of the brilliant concept is concerned however, just about everything that could go wrong does go wrong. and then some!first, the acting. the acting is almost uniformly terrible right across the board. this factor does the most damage to the production, undermining any possible credibility of belief or interest on the part of the viewer. the voice of the vengeful spirit sounds more like a teenage girl experiencing teenage angst rather than a powerful demonic force expressing malevolent intent. i almost laughed when i heard some of her lines. unfortunately, this voice began to become very annoying very quickly! i may not have been alive in the 1800s, but i find it incredibly hard to believe that any young woman alive at that time would speak in the way that this ghost does!second, the direction. the direction is haphazard and very uneven. some scenes show promise but potential is squandered by the clearly inexperienced director. nothing is done with the camera, with sound or with lighting to add intensity to the scenes intended to be scary. the atmosphere is equally flat. a vengeful spirit is supposedly behind supernatural occurrences. yet the effects are so incredibly inept that no one who has seen a proper horror movie would buy into them. ill give one example. in one scene, the spirit attacks someone. see the scene for yourself. its almost funny - almost.third, the script. whilst it may be the case that the events shown are faithful to accounts of real occurrences, it cannot be denied that most scenes are incredibly flat and boring. scenes as short as two minutes feel much longer thanks to the poor dialogue - dialogue that fails to add depth to the characters or story. this movie is far too reliant on conversations to advance the story. whilst this style was also the case with british movies from the british horror heyday of the 1960s and 1970s, it cannot be denied that the dialogue exchanges were always interesting to watch in these more professional earlier works. peter cushing for example could read a telephone directory and still hold attention of the viewers. the same cannot be said of the actors in the haunt.finally, the humour. the ill-guided attempts at humour in this movie are excruciating. an obese boy is the butt of many jokes. one particularly awful scene sees the said boy going to the outside toilet. this scene should never have been included - but it is and complete with sound effects in case you fail to understand what he is doing!the only positive points about the movie are the location and the costumes. the decision to shoot the picture near the original location helped add some authenticity. the costumes were also well chosen.overall, the haunt is an appalling movie. it is not even in the so bad its good league. it is instead just boring. i advise everyone to save their money and avoid this movie like the plague. dont even bother seeing it for free!i have never seen the other movie about the bell witch. but it really couldnt be any worse than the haunt. could it? ill give this other movie a chance if i can track it down.in the meantime, i would advise everyone on here to check out some proper horror movies about ghosts and haunting. the legend of hell house, the changeling, ringu, the grudge (japanese original) and one missed call (japanese original) are good places to start.",0
"this movie is amazing because the fact that the real people portray themselves and their real life experience and do such a good job its like theyre almost living the past over again. jia hongsheng plays himself an actor who quit everything except music and drugs struggling with depression and searching for the meaning of life while being angry at everyone especially the people who care for him most. theres moments in the movie that will make you wanna cry because the family especially the father did such a good job. however, this movie is not for everyone. many people who suffer from depression will understand hongshengs problem and why he does the things he does for example keep himself shut in a dark room or go for walks or bike rides by himself. others might see the movie as boring because its just so real that its almost like a documentary. overall this movie is great and hongsheng deserved an oscar for this movie so did his dad.",1
"to summarize, my group of friends and i spent about 45 minutes outside the theater sharing our favorites gaffes, plot inconsistencies, untied loose ends, and other ridiculous aspects of this movie. i found the story trite to the point of inconsequential and the plot lines as underdeveloped as the dino embryos still locked in the shaving cream canister from jurassic park 1. the editing was poor and none of the characters engendered any sort of sympathy or feeling. in short, this movie lacked any of the suspense and thrill that the first movie provided from a story standpointeven the new dinosaurs were few and far between (although i really enjoyed the pterodactyls.) we got several brief shots of the new species and only 2 really were involved in the action.as a scientist and former childhood paleontologist, the lack of any real scientific content (not that it had to be realistic, but logically formed i.e. how they built the dinos in #1 and malcoms chaos ramblings) was disappointing as well.in short, the movie seemed to be nothing more than an excuse to trot dinos back on the scene to make some money. i hope that movie-goers dont fall for this trap again (although i did apparently)",0
"i was surprised how much i enjoyed this. sure it is a bit slow moving in parts, but what else would one expect from rollin? also there is plenty of nudity, nothing wrong with that, particularly as it includes lots of the gorgeous, brigitte lahaie. there are also some spectacularly eroticised female dead, bit more dodgey, perhaps, but most effective. there is also a sci-fi like storyline with a brief explanation at the end, but i wouldnt bother too much with that. no, here we have a most interesting exploration of memory and the effect of memory loss and to just what extent one is still alive without memory. my dvd sleeve mentions david cronenberg and whilst this is perhaps not quite as good as his best films, there is some similarity here, particularly with the great use of seemingly menacing architecture and the effective and creepy use of inside space. as i have tried to indicate this is by no means a rip roaring thriller, it is a captivating, nightmare like movie that makes the very most of its locations, including a stunning railway setting at the end.",1

"i kid you not. yes, whos that girl has the distinction for being one in a string of madonnas films that bombed, but i actually liked this movie more than desperately seeking susan. in susan, madonnas character is relegated to being second-fiddle to rosanna arquette and is not given much to work with. no disrespect to rosanna, but in wtg madonna plays this zany, outrageous character, only done in an 80s style. while it may seem cheesy today, this is actually one of madonnas best and one of her most underrated films.madonna plays nikki finn, an ex-con who is sent to the slammer for a crime she didnt commit. shes being released from jail after four years of good behavior. griffin dunne, who is also a very underrated actor, plays louden trott, a lawyer who has the unpleasant task of picking her up from jail to take her to the bus station. of course, when these two get together, thats when the madness happens. sir john mills has a small role as the rich businessman who has a huge mansion in the middle of manhattan with a rainforest(???) on his roof. this movie parodies everything. rich people, the sleazy characters who live in harlem and totally destroy loudens rolls-royce, the gay cops who follow madonna and dunne around town, and dunnes stuck-up fiance wendy worthington who has purportedly slept with every cab driver in new york city (played by haviland morris, who was jakes girlfriend caroline in sixteen candles). hilarious! plus, dunne is also in charge of a rare breed of leopard reminiscent of bringing up baby. plus, madonna had a great platinum blonde 80s look back in those days and the movie has a great soundtrack. throw this all into the mix and you have the zaniness of wtg.madonna is the queen of deadpan acting. there are times in the movie where she says a line totally straight and surprisingly, it turns out to be funny! thats how some of the best comedy should be played - straight. madonna should have done more comedy and it was a shame that she did not choose to do so. later on she became much more controversial and got into more of the dark, sexually-charged roles in the notorious movies body of evidence and dangerous game. some people say madonna cannot act, and that is fine, people are entitled to their opinion, but i believe the real problem is that people cannot see the difference between madonna playing a character on film, instead they still see only madonna and that is main reason why she is given more respect for her music than for her movies. its still a fun, screwball comedy of the 80s. not for everyone, im sure some of you will dislike it, so i would recommend it mainly for madonna fans, but you never know, you might be surprised and like it! interesting note: one of madonnas friends from her early-80s new york club days, coati mundi, who plays raoul, was a member in the bands kid creole and the coconuts and savannah band.",1
"i saw this film over christmas, and what a great film it was! it tells the story of custer (played by errol flynn) during and after his graduation from westpoint. although ive heard that the film isnt very historically accurate (hollywood never is) i still enjoyed it as i knew little of the real events anyway.i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor! his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic! it brought me close to tears as he and ned sharp (arthur kennedy) rode to their deaths on little big horn.i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor, and i grew up watching his films as a child. but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was.ill give this film 10 out of 10!!",1

"dashing errol flynn brings his usual flair for drama in this historically flawed but entertaining film of the life of george armstrong custer. the dashing, jovial flynn essays custer from his days at west point as a reckless, headstrong cadet, through the civil war years in an extraordinarily generous and partisan interpretation of history, and finally as the nonpareil indian fighter whose blunder at the little big horn is excused as a sacrifice by custer of his command as a way of exposing the corruption of government officials and post traders as well as a protest of the unfair treatment of the plains indians. olivia de havilland, flynns co-star in several other films, scores as the devoted, adoring libby bacon, and anthony quinn looks the part as the fierce sioux chief crazy horse. the films battle scenes are excellent. the civil war battles are brief and are shown as several vignettes in which custer, seemingly supported by just a handful of troopers, hammers the confederate army into submission. custers last fight against the indians is a grand spectacle, a savage clash between red men and white, with no quarter given in a wild mix of military might between determined fighting men. great direction, cinematography, casting and wonderful music by max steiner make this film a hollywood classic.",1
this movie could very well have been a propaganda movie for the north americian falangist party - or some similar group... the strong man (kersey) places himself above the law (but not outside the law) and liberates upstanding citizens by killing worthless trash. the only thing that made me think it wasnt made by the kkk was the fact that a jew starred as a good guy... try watching it again while thinking of it as a propaganda movie for an extreme right wing group - and youll see what i mean...its a tragedy that jimmy page actually made music for this movie... :(,0

"i saw this film at the rotterdam international film festival 2002. this seemed to be one of the less popular films on the festival, however, as it turned out, all the more interesting.the story, of an actor trying to come to grips with himself and his environment after withdrawing from a drug addiction, is based on actual facts. moreover, the characters playing in the film are the real people living this experience over again, this time for the film, which is partly set up as a stage play. not only do they all happen to be good actors, jia hongshengs parents are actors in real life as well, the methods used in highlighting their relationship towards jia are very effective.jia hongsheng is the actor of some chinese action films late eighties start nineties. later you can see him in great films such as frozen and suzhou river. in between these two career paths jia becomes a drug addict and looses all drive to act or even do anything productive, except for making somewhat futile attempts at becoming a guitar virtuoso.i like the way the writer of the scenario choose to emphasize on his behavior after withdrawal more than on the horror of drugs. we really feel the pain and struggle jia is in. at the same time we hate him for the way he treats those around him.the film draws the viewer into a tiring pattern jia seems to be caught in, dragging with him his parents and sister who try to take care of him. because there are personal interviews with the characters we feel like we are getting to know jia not only through himself but through others as well.the film has a heavy feel, but scenes of jia cycling through bejing and partying with his friends lighten the tone. so does the bitter humor in a lot of events throughout the film. the music is beautiful and stayed with me for a while after. this is a film that might not easily appeal to many people but for those interested in the more serious and modern chinese film this is a strong recommendation.",1
"this is indeed one of the weakest films based on agatha christies work, a lifeless, muddled mystery that clearly lacks the grace (and the budget!) of its predecessors (death on the nile, evil under the sun) and donald sutherland is a pale shadow of peter ustinov as far as screen detectives go (of course, he is playing a character much less interesting than poirot). the film manages to coast as far as it does on the strength of christies plot alone (all her plots have a certain amount of inherent interest), but the direction is hopelessly flat.

"being warner brothers second historical drama featuring civil war and battle of the little big horn, general george armstrong custer, they died with their boots on (warner brothers, 1941) was the far more accurate of the two; especially when contrasted with santa fe trail (warner brothers, 1940), which really didnt set the bar very high.although both pictures were starring vehicles for errol flynn, there was a change in the casting the part of general custer. whereas it was dutch, himself, ronald reagan portraying the flamboyant, egomaniacal cavalryman in the earlier picture, with mr. flynn playing virginian and later confederate hero general, j.e.b. (or jeb) stuart; errol took on the custer part for they died with their boots on.once again, the warner brothers propensity for using a large number of reliable character actors from the warners repertory company are employed in giving the film a sort of authenticity, and all is really happening right before our very own eyes. major roles are taken by some better known actors and actresses, such as: elizabeth bacon/mrs. custer (co-star olivia de havilland), ned sharpe (arthur kennedy), samuel bacon (gene lockhart), chief crazy horse (anthony quinn), californy (charlie grapwin), major taipe (stanley ridges), general phillip sheridan (john litel), callie (the bacons maid, hattie mcdaniel). the rest of the cast is just chock full of uncredited, though skilled players such as: joe sawyer, eleanor parker, minor watson, tod andrews, irving bacon, roy barcroft, lane chandler, spencer charters, frank ferguson, francis ford, william forrest, george eldridge, russell hicks, william hopper, hoppity hooper, eddie keane, fred kelsey, sam mcdaniel, patrick mcvey, frank orth, eddie parker, addison richards, ray teal, jim thorpe (all-american, himself), minerva urecal, dick wessel, gig young and many, many more.the film moves very quickly, particularly in the early goings; then sort of slows down out of necessity as the story moves along to the post civil war years, the assignment of custer as a colonel in the 7th cavalry and the ultimate destiny at the little big horn, in montana. under the guidance of director, griffith veteran, raoul walsh, the film hits a greatly varied array of emotions; from the very serious, exciting battle scenes and convincing historical scenes; looking as if they were matthew brady civil war photos. as with most any of mr. walshs films, he punctuates and expedites the end of many a scene with a little humor; but not going overboard and thus risking the chance of turning the film into a comedy (farce, actually).as previously mentioned, this is much more factual than its predecessor, santa fe trail (last time well mention it, honest schultz, scouts honor!). however, that is not to say that it wasnt without a few little bits of artistic and literary license; as indeed, just about any biopic will have. it would be impossible to make any similar type of film if indeed every fact and incident were to be tried to be included in the screenplay. perhaps the most erroneous inclusion as well as the most obvious invocation of literary license is that business about custers being accidentally promoted to the rank of brigadier general. it just didnt happen that way, yet the gag both helped the film to move along; while it underscored the whole light, carefree feeling that permeated the early part of the film.director walsh and mr. flynn collaborated in giving us what would seem to be a characterization of this legendary civil war hero that was very close to the real life man. and they did this on top of the recreation of an incident, being the massacre by the lakota sioux, the cheyenne and the fukowi of custer and his 7th cavalry at the little big horn. at the time of its occurrence, june 25, 1876, custers last stand was as big an incident and shock to the americans national psyche as were the japanese attack on pearl harbor (december 7, 1941) or the atrocities perpetrated by the islamic fascists to new yorks twin trade towers and the united states armed forces headquarters in the pentagon, arlington, virginia on september 11, 2002.just as so many films of that period of world war ii (and the years immediately before), there were so many incidents in it that were, if not intentionally done, were demonstrations of virtues that would be needed in time of another global conflict, such as we were in by the time of they died with their boots on was finishing up its original theatrical release period.poodle schnitz!!",1
"i am really sad that that this film has got so much negative criticism. i think it is a nice little comedy and really funny. the humour in this film is kind of warm and innocent and i like it. i also like madonnas character and i do not agree that she played herself. she has created a character and a sympathetic one. my favourite scenes were the fighting scene on top of the sinking car and where madonna climbs over the fence in a fancy dress to claim her love. the humour in the film has a slightly syrrealistic touch and perhaps it is not everybodys cup of tea. but its their problem, not of the film. i found this film wholesome and sunny. in fact, the day i first saw it i was incredibly sad for some reason and this film lit up my day. and madonna can act. just take off your glasses of negative thinking.",1
"this is an example of why the majority of action films are the same. generic and boring, theres really nothing worth watching here. a complete waste of the then barely-tapped talents of ice-t and ice cube, whove each proven many times over that they are capable of acting, and acting well. dont bother with this one, go see new jack city, ricochet or watch new york undercover for ice-t, or boyz n the hood, higher learning or friday for ice cube and see the real deal. ice-ts horribly cliched dialogue alone makes this film grate at the teeth, and im still wondering what the heck bill paxton was doing in this film? and why the heck does he always play the exact same character? from aliens onward, every film ive seen with bill paxton has him playing the exact same irritating character, and at least in aliens his character died, which made it somewhat gratifying...overall, this is second-rate action trash. there are countless better films to see, and if you really want to see this one, watch judgement night, which is practically a carbon copy but has better acting and a better script. the only thing that made this at all worth watching was a decent hand on the camera - the cinematography was almost refreshing, which comes close to making up for the horrible film itself - but not quite. 4/10.",0
"i loved this movie from beginning to end.i am a musician and i let drugs get in the way of my some of the things i used to love(skateboarding,drawing) but my friends were always there for me.music was like my rehab,life support,and my drug.it changed my life.i can totally relate to this movie and i wish there was more i could say.this movie left me speechless to be honest.i just saw it on the ifc channel.i usually hate having satellite but this was a perk of having satellite.the ifc channel shows some really great movies and without it i never would have found this movie.im not a big fan of the international films because i find that a lot of the dont do a very good job on translating lines.i mean the obvious language barrier leaves you to just believe thats what they are saying but its not that big of a deal i guess.i almost never got to see this amazing movie.good thing i stayed up for it instead of going to bed..well earlier than usual.lol.i hope you all enjoy the hell of this movie and love this movie just as much as i did.i wish i could type this all in caps but its again the rules i guess thats shouting but it would really show my excitement for the film.i give it three thumbs way up!this movie blew me away!",1
"finding this piece sandwiched between a stale prequel and a rehashed 80s machomovie on a upn affiliates midday saturday program would be misleading. it deserves better and definitely uses its talented leads best attributes to its maximum advantage. bracco and walken team to provide a movie that while perhaps predictable to those familiar with their genre, do the streetwise, troubled minds routine that they are so good at portraying. for a chance to ride a psychological roller coaster a la fuquas training day, dive back into the world of early 90s tv movies to find scam!",1
"we open in a doctors room of some sort. a girl is escorted to a seat across from the doctor. he asks her questions. silence follows. he continues to ask questions, ignoring the girls obvious traumatised atmosphere.the story is about two girls who are taken home, after spending some time in a mental home after an incident that happened before hand. they are greeted on their arrival by their trying-way-too-hard-to-be-nice-but-so-totally-evil stepmother, who the girls obviously hold resentment for. as time goes on at home, the evil stepmother finds new ways to torment the girls. and, to top it all off, there is a vengeful ghost that is far from helping the girls recovery...this film is amazing. it has twist, turns, and definitely leaves you a lot to think about without not making sense. the relationship between the two girls is so heartwarming, it almost makes you cry at some points (i know i had a teary moment of two, specifically the cupboard scene). but what i love most about this film is the total feeling of dread all the way through to the rolling credits. the soundtrack is faultless, the furnishings in the house, and the use of colour are fantastic. a pure joy for the eyes. this is a definite must-see for all asian movie fanatics. or any sort of movie fan! an easy 10/10.",1
"supercraptastic slasher fare, which feels overly long at 80 minutes. years ago, a bunch of gypsies who lived in the caves of a mountain, were burned up in a forest fire. years later, campers are going missing from the area of the fire. a bunch of horny kids are, of course, en route to this area for a debaucherous camping trip of there own. despite an ominous welcome from the forest ranger (jackson bostwick) the kids troop up to the mountain any way. before long, the kids start to get picked off by the monster, who remains unseen to the very end of the movie, probably because the makeup was so embarrassingly bad. no surprises to speak of: they get killed in the exact order that the formula for these movies dictates, leaving the final girl to fend for herself, although in a refreshingly downbeat denouement, the final girl ends up imprisoned and impregnated by the monster.the story itself couldnt hold the weight of feature length, so it was padded out by seemingly endless shots of wildlife and insects, which were obviously shot for another film and inserted here haphazardously as a means of making the movie long enough for a video release. on the plus side, the wildlife footage is rather nice. also among the highlights are bostwick talking to a baby deer, a decent rock-climbing death sequence, ok gore, and the great jackie coogan in his final film role, as the bumbling local sheriff. this is a far cry from charlie chaplin, but it was still nice to see him. this is for slasher completists only.",0
"so keira knightly is in it...so automatically we compare this film to attonement. aside rom the fact that this film is also wartime and her appearance is uncanning, these films are totally different.the actors work well, i think one good thing is there is no memorable person, they are a team.if you want a film where things happen, then id advise another as the story of this film is about human interaction and their physches damaged by their experiences and how their lives are intertwined.this film have genuine interaction, perfect pause moments that make you hold your breath. no its not exciting, but it is gripping if you can empathise with these characters. at moments i wondered if this film may have been better as a theatrical play rather than a movie. we expect a lot from movies as everything is possible, and yet with theatre we allow for interaction and rely on belief.there are things wrong with it if your looking for a blockbuster, if you look for nothing and allow the film to take you in, move you, allow yourself to forget these stars, and not to judge them as actors but let them become people, you will truly ind yourself moved.go on!! give it a go!",1
"bill paxton has taken the true story of the 1913 us golf open and made a film that is about much more than an extra-ordinary game of golf. the film also deals directly with the class tensions of the early twentieth century and touches upon the profound anti-catholic prejudices of both the british and american establishments. but at heart the film is about that perennial favourite of triumph against the odds.the acting is exemplary throughout. stephen dillane is excellent as usual, but the revelation of the movie is shia laboeuf who delivers a disciplined, dignified and highly sympathetic performance as a working class franco-irish kid fighting his way through the prejudices of the new england wasp establishment. for those who are only familiar with his slap-stick performances in even stevens this demonstration of his maturity is a delightful surprise. and josh flitter as the ten year old caddy threatens to steal every scene in which he appears.a old fashioned movie in the best sense of the word: fine acting, clear directing and a great story that grips to the end - the final scene an affectionate nod to casablanca is just one of the many pleasures that fill a great movie.",1
"this is a family movie that was broadcast on my local itv station at 1.00 am a couple of nights ago . this might be a strange decision on the part of the schedulers but the real howard spitz is a rather strange film , strange in the way it doesnt want to upset its audience . come on theres nothing kids like more than sadism and thats why roald dahl was such a popular author for children . it also explains why doctor who was such a successful show across the world . in this screenplay youre just dying for pulp fiction author to do something nasty to the kids but this doesnt happen . im not advocating child abuse but to see howard spitz lose his rag at the little ones would have made the movie rather better . can you imagine how much worse kindergarten cop would have been if the producers had gone all pc ? i mean if youre making a movie centered around a childrens author who hates children shouldnt the story show and not tell ? much of the problem lies with director vadim jean and you do get the feeling he doesnt know how to handle the material which is bad news for the movie . as someone previously noted the soundtrack is haphazard and kelsey grammar is very wooden . i guess he was trying to play it dead pan just like in that show hes famous for but it fails to work here and theres many scenes with quiet ridiculous camera angles which seem unintentional but which are very distracting . but at the end of the day the main problem remains that the potential is ruined because no one wanted to offend the audiences sensibilities",0
"donald sutherland, an american paleontologist visiting england, picks up a hitch hiker one evening. two years later, having discovered the mans address book in his car, he returns the book to the mans opulent home, only to find that the mans been hanged for murder. nobody in or out of the family seems to care that the hitch hiker could not have committed the murder (of his own stepmother) because he was in sutherlands car at the time of the crime.sutherland is the mans alibi but hes turned up too late. out of a sense of guilt, he tracks down the real murderer.agatha christies mysteries usually involve a number of diverse people, all of them with one or another motive for the crime, all of them suspect, and a puzzle that depends on the construction of a strict time line. there is often, not always, a sidekick with whom the investigator can talk things over.because of the anfractuosity of the situation, due care must be taken to explain each element of the mystery to the reader or viewer. redundancy is perfectly okay. we have to keep the characters and the time lines straight. christies movies are of the rare kind in which the use of famous faces in subordinate characters is actually useful. (jacqueline de bellefort? oh, yes, thats mia farrow.) but this version of ordeal by innocence is a golan-globus production, with all that implies in the way of production values, a thoughtfully prepared script, and skill behind the camera.the first few minutes, in which sutherland discovers that an innocent man has been hanged, are fine. after that, everything is flung at the viewer in disjointed scraps, often in sudden flashbacks or in confusing voiceovers that tell us nothing. the script has a slapdash quality, as if thrown together by two hacks overnight. few of the faces are familiar and that doesnt help at all. everyone drops remarks about everyone else and the names become a hopeless jumble. the musical score consists of four instruments doing irritating atonal jazz riffs. some nudity is thrown in to wake up the dozers in the audience. if dame agatha were alive, shed be among the viewers who needed to be shaken awake.dullsville.",0
"this failed exercise in satire or commentary on the human condition easily earned a place as one of the 10 worst movies ive ever seen. im seriously considering buying a copy, if i can find one dirt cheap, to chase away unwanted company. its honestly that bad. i view it as some kind of anti-personnel weapon. if youre the kind of person who just has to see a train wreck to witness the carnage, then this movie is a gem. just to be fair, kelsey grammars character has 1 line that almost works, but doesnt quite. other than that everything in this movie strives to be insightful, but misses the mark by approximately the distance between earth and the nearest pair of colliding galaxies. i usually can appreciate a book or movie where the protagonist suffers from some sort of existential angst, but the angst presented here is so unbelievable and over the top, and the movie doesnt even address the nonsense it presents in any valuable way. if you are familiar with the term word vomit then you may get some picture of the cinematrocity. oh, and the narrative structure is ill conceived, pretentious and amateurish. it has failed on both style and substance. if you really hate someone, invite them over for a double feature of this movie and the terror of tiny town, an all midget western from the 1930s and put them in restraints with their eyes forced open a clockwork orange style. but that probably violates some provision in the geneva conventions.",0
its clear that for this film they wanted to have the story line driven by the characters. but immediately the story line causes you to dislike the new main characters. the fly-over of the island and dinosaurs below lacked any impact at all and almost looked like a cartoon. the all action entrance to the island is merely a rehash of parts from jp 1 and 2. the story-line is predictable to the point of annoyance and its entirely unsatisfying end left me feeling cheated. this gave me with no option but to award the film 3/10!,0
